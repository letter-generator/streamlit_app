It is shown that the diffusion of atoms, the Ostwald ripening effect, and Brownian movement together control the growth of small size particles. It appears that this stage of initial precipitation lasts for only about 10 s. When the particle diameter exceeds a threshold of 1 m, the growth process becomes dominated by particle collisions and agglomeration. The efficiency of these mechanisms depends on the particle size distribution as produced during growth. Comprehensive evaluations are still impeded by the limited capacity of computers at present.

In order to account for the turbulent circulating flow induced by gas bubbling through the bottom, the kappa-epsilon turbulence model was employed to evaluate time-averaged Reynolds stress while the fluctuation of the free surface of the melt was traced by means of the VOF technique. This model enables to couple transient flow fields, and temperature fields with concentration fields of elements and inclusions in melt so that it can meet the requirements of evolution of time- and space-dependent particle size distributions (PSD) without any given initial PSID of inclusions but directly from chemical reaction. The model was applied to the simulation of the molten steel deoxidation process in Fe-Al-O system in an argon gas-stirred ladle. The model successfully predicted important phenomena including turbulent recirculation flow patterns, streamline structure of steel melt, turbulence energy variation and its dissipation rate, transient temperature fields and particle size distributions of alumina inclusion. Comparison with some industrial data showed that the predicted PSDs were reasonable in time-dependent variation of inclusion size distribution.

We find that at high oxygen potentials (% FeO 0.7 in the slag), reactions between slag FeO and the deoxidant predominate. At low oxygen potentials (% FeO 0.2 in the slag) exchange reactions between deoxidant and the slag components control the inclusion composition. At intermediate oxygen potentials, the inclusion composition is strongly influenced by the SiO2 content of the slag. The manufacture of low-oxygen, low-sulphur steels by ESR will hence require slags with small contents of both SiO2 and Al2O3. Authors: A. Mitchell, F. Reyes-Carmona, E.

In present study, the measured and calculated oxygen activities in Al-killed bulk steel were compared according to industrial trails, and the Fe O equilibrium at the interface between slag and steel was also concerned by thermodynamic analysis. Finally, the deoxidation mechanism of Al-killed during industrial refining was proposed. It is found that the activity of oxygen in bulk steel is controlled by Al content, since the activity of oxygen in bulk steel is very close to the equilibrium value as the activity of Al2O3 is treated as unity. In order to keep low oxygen in molten steel, a certain Al content needs to be guaranteed. At slag-steel interface, the activity of oxygen is controlled by FeO, which is much larger than that of bulk steel, so the oxygen would transfer from slag into bulk steel. Slagging therefore presents its importance for deoxidation to reduce the oxygen transfer. Besides, the essence of SiO2 supplying oxygen is Al consumption in bulk steel, which gives rise to the increase of dissolved oxygen. So, stable refining slag is also very important to obtain low oxygen steel, and the slag basicity needs to be no smaller than 3 to reduce the Al consumption caused by SiO2 reduction. In present study, the basicity of 3 4 is recommended to refine low oxygen Al-killed steel. Authors: Zhiyin Deng, Miaoyong Zhu", "chunk_tokens": 319, "total_tokens": 319, "is_full_text": true}

Abstract: In the deoxidation producing the MnO-SiO2-Al2O3 inclusions, the significant ununiformity in the temperature dependence of equilibrium constant among the deoxidation reactions may cause the inclusions to change in their composition in cooling processes till solidification of steel melt. The present work concerns the compositional variation of the inclusions formed in the Mn-Si deoxidation of steel, focused on alumina content in the cooling process from 1848 to 1773 K. In order to take the mass balances of the components involved in a reaction system, a reaction region was introduced which consisted of liquid steel bath and a certain amount of the oxides belonging to added flux and refractory of refining vessels. The compositional variation of the inclusions was estimated on the basis of the deoxidation equilibria and the mass balances. The thermodynamic analysis has revealed that the composition of inclusions has such a temperature dependence as to be considerably influenced by the initial total contents of reactants involved in the deoxidation system. It is suggested that high total contents of aluminum and oxygen in the initial state reduce the temperature dependence and thereby will facilitate the composition control in the cooling process till solidification. In Mn-Si deoxidation, there may be two approaches to control alumina content of inclusions; one is to leave the target composition once attained at an appropriate temperature till solidification intact, and the other is to form inclusions stable on temperature falling through regulating the initial total contents of aluminum and oxygen to adequately high levels.

They tend not to aggregate and form cluster. The MgO content in the inclusions decreases, while the SiO2 content increases with the progress of experiment. Larger inclusions are removed by floating up with the rising bubbles more easily and the fine inclusions tend to remain in the melt. The oxygen concentrations originated from the inclusions can be reasonably explained from the experimental analysis ones.By use of the MgO porous immersion tube, deoxidation proceeds slowly at the initial stage, but it continues until the later stage of experiment, in contrast to that using the dense Al2O3 immersion tube. The formed inclusion number per unit area has a larger value than that with the dense Al2O3 tube. The number of inclusions also increases with increasing the initial oxygen concentration and dividing pellets charging into several portions. When the carrier gas flow rate is large, the number of inclusions tends to increase at the later stage of experiment due to the strong involvement of inclusions from the melt surface into the melt.In the present deoxidation process, it is considered that the rapid removal of larger inclusions by rising bubbles is beneficial to produce high cleanness steel, while the remaining fine inclusions is helpful for the grain refinement of steel during the solidification and phase transformation process.

In the present study, high carbon chromium bearing steels are smelted with a strong deoxidizer and a weak deoxidizer, respectively in industrial trials. The generation mechanism of inclusions is analyzed, and the inclusion stability diagrams of the Fe Si Al Mg Mn O system at 1873 and 1843 K are calculated. The very high cycle fatigue life of bearing steels deoxidized with different deoxidizers is also experimentally compared. The results showed that the evolution routes of inclusion in high carbon chromium bearing steels deoxidized by Si and Al are CaO Al 2 O 3 SiO 2 → CaO Al 2 O 3 SiO 2 MgO and Al 2 O 3 → CaO Al 2 O 3 SiO 2 MgO, respectively. The Al content in steel is controlled by different methods when different deoxidizers are applied. The effect of the oxide inclusions generated during Si deoxidization on the fatigue life is lower than that during Al deoxidization, even if the total oxygen content is slightly higher. This effect suggests that it is not accurate to evaluate the fatigue life of steels with the total oxygen content, and it is also desirable to produce bearing steels with the Si deoxidation method.

The present study first optimized the thermodynamic model by supplementing thermodynamic data of the RE-compound to study the formation of various inclusions in the Ce Si Al O system. On this basis, laboratory-scale experiments with different deoxidation conditions were designed to obtain samples containing one single type of inclusions, viz., SiO2, SiO2 Ce2O3 or SiO2 Al2O3 Ce2O3, respectively. Subsequently, the agglomeration behavior of inclusions was observed in situ by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), and the corresponding attractive forces were calculated to compare the agglomeration tendency of various inclusions. The results indicate that, in the Si deoxidized samples, SiO2 Ce2O3 inclusions agglomerate to form clusters with the attractive force of 4.3 × 10 17N to 4.2 × 10 15N, which is weaker than that of Al2O3 and Al2O3 Ce2O3 inclusions after Al deoxidation. Although SiO2 inclusions can agglomerate, their attractive force is only 6.3 × 10 19N to 1.2 × 10 16N, which is the weakest of the above inclusions. In the case of Si/Al complex deoxidization, spherical SiO2 Al2O3 Ce2O3 liquid inclusions are formed after Ce treatment, and no agglomeration of such inclusions was observed in situ. The study could provide theoretical guidance for improving the nozzle-clogging problem of RE-containing steel from inclusion-controlling perspective under different deoxidation conditions.

The pellets composed of MgO and Al are charged into an immersion tube and the magnesium vapor produced in situ by aluminothermic reduction of magnesium oxide is injected directly into molten steel to react with the dissolved sulfur and oxygen in it. Effects of various operating parameters on desulfurization and deoxidation are discussed.In the case of the high initial oxygen concentration, deoxidation of molten steel proceeds preferentially, and desulfurization does not take place. When the oxygen concentration in the melt is low enough, desulfurization of molten steel with magnesium vapor can proceed.A higher initial sulfur concentration increases the desufurization ratio of molten steel. The sulfur concentration in the melt tends to be in equilibrium with the magnesium partial pressure in the Mg Ar bubble rather than the dissolved magnesium concentration in the melt. Increasing pellet mass promoted desulfurization of molten steel. The maximum desulfurization ratio of molten steel can be obtained at a relatively low argon carrier gas flow rate. In both cases of the porous magnesia and the dense alumina immersion tubes with injecting holes, addition of lime onto the melt surface increases the desulfurization ratio. The desulfurization using the dense alumina tube is accompanied by resulfurization more significantly at the later stage than that using the porous magnesia tube.

In this context, quenched steel samples are collected from the tundish before and after the aforementioned process change. Nonmetallic inclusions characterization is manually performed using scanning electron microscope. For both conditions before and after the industrial process changes the inclusions are typically globular ones. However, before the changes, the inclusion modification is not complete because the core of the inclusions is composed by polygonal spinel. After the changes, the inclusions become homogeneous. Computational thermodynamics is applied to calculate the castability windows; they show that the amount of calcium dissolved in liquid steel is too low before the process changes, and this fact explains the blockage of the tundish nozzles, which is observed at steelworks, due to the deposition of high melting point spinel inclusions.

De-oxidation tests were carried out by adding either aluminum (0.05 mass%) or titanium (0.05, 0.03 or 0.015 mass%) to an iron melt in a 400 g-scale vacuum furnace. A Confocal Scanning Laser Microscope (CSLM) was used to evaluate the effect of cooling rate by re-melting and quenching during solidification. Fine secondary de-oxidation particles were obtained in the Ti-killed samples, and the particle density increased with increasing oxygen content, and their size decreased with increasing the cooling rate during solidification.The secondary Ti de-oxidation particles were found to have an effect on microstructure evolution, such as solidifying microstructure, austenite grain growth and austenite decomposition. The de-oxidation particles were examined through FE-TEM and were identified to be TiO, MnTiO3 and Mn2TiO4, in low oxygen ( O 7 ppm) and high oxygen ( O 56, 81 ppm) Ti-killed steels respectively, which were qualitatively same as those predicted by thermodynamic calculations. Stabilities of TiO, MnTiO3 and Mn2TiO4 are influenced by Mn presence. Composition change and decomposition of oxide were estimated through thermodynamic calculations. The effect of the particles on ferrite formation was evaluated through thermo-mechanical treatments. TiO was the most effective for promoting ferrite formation through heterogeneous nucleation. The particles contributed to ferrite formation in the following order, TiO TiN MnS MnTiO3 Ti2O3.It was found that the secondary Ti de-oxidation particles work are engulfed by the advancing solid phase during solidification based on analysis with PET (Pushing Engulfment Transition) velocity, particle sizes and solidification rates.

Although the aluminum deoxidation process can reduce the oxygen content in steel to 10 × 10 6, this deoxidation method causes fatigue failure resulting from the formation of large-grained spherical (Ds-type) inclusions composed of calcium aluminate. It also tends to lead to nozzle blockage during casting. Given the above problems, this study conducted an in-depth investigation of silicon manganese deoxidation. Thermal experiments and thermodynamic calculations were used to assess the impact of different Mn Si ratios on the oxygen content and inclusion characteristics during the deoxidation process of molten steel with different initial oxygen contents. The experimental samples were analyzed using an oxygen nitrogen hydrogen analyzer, a direct reading spectrometer, and an automatic scanning electron microscope. After that, the samples were electrolyzed to observe the 2D morphology and 3D morphology of the inclusions using scanning electron microscopy. Finally, thermodynamic calculations were carried out using FactSage to verify the experimental results. The results indicated that, regardless of the initial oxygen content, silicon manganese deoxidation maintained the total oxygen content at 35 × 10 6. It effectively managed the plasticization of inclusions in molten steel, predominantly yielding spherical silicates while minimizing Al-containing inclusions. Nevertheless, as the initial content of O increased, the size and density of the silicate inclusions in the steel also increased. An optimal point in the number and size of inclusions was observed with an increased Mn Si ratio. Moreover, the combined utilization of silicon manganese deoxidation, diffusion deoxidation, and vacuum deoxidation enabled ultra-low oxygen content control of molten steel.

The model was developed based on the slag steel equilibrium theory, the law of mass conservation, as well as the ion and molecule coexistence theory. And the model involves the Si Mn Cr Fe S O reaction system. By comparing the measured values and the model-predicted values, the model has been proved that can effectively predict the equilibrium oxygen and sulphur contents in 201 SS with CaO SiO2 MgO CaF2 slag. The average deviation between the model-predicted value and the measured value is 1.5×10 6. Both the model-predicted values and the measured values show that a high basicity is beneficial for the deoxidation and desulphurisation of steel. Moreover, the measured values of the minimum oxygen and sulphur contents are 8.69×10 6 and 8.10×10 6, respectively, which are obtained at B≥1.9. Increasing the MgO content at B 1.7 to within 5 wt-% slightly improves the deoxidation and desulphurisation of the steel, while it has no effect at (% MgO)≥7.0. Increasing the CaF2 content in the range of 20 40 wt-% slightly decreases the equilibrium sulphur content (3.6×10 6) in the steel, but it does not affect the equilibrium oxygen content. As a result, the optimum slag for both the deoxidation and desulphurisation of 201 SS is to maintain a binary basicity range of 1.9 2.1, with MgO content at saturation state and CaF2 content at 40 wt-%. In addition, the deoxidation and desulphurisation mechanisms between CaO SiO2 MgO CaF2 initial slag and 201 SS are discussed based on the developed model.

Compared to base alloy, Ti Mg Ce added alloy features a higher presence of inclusions such as MgO, TiN (containing Ce), TiOx, and TiS, except for SiO2, Al2O3, MnS, and MnO. Following Ti Mg Ce composite deoxidation, the number density of inclusions increases by 16.4%, and the equivalent diameter, length, and width of the inclusions decrease by 41.0%, 41.2%, and 37.9%, respectively.

The morphologies (SEM) and elemental distributions (EDS) of TiN and sulfide inclusions in steel are characterized using scanning electron microscopy, and the sizes of the inclusions are statistically analyzed. With the addition of rare earth La, the average sizes of TiN and sulfide inclusions in steel decrease, and the proportions of TiN and sulfide inclusions in all inclusions of the steel decrease. The results show that the addition of La element can promote the formation of LaAlO3 in steel, which can be used as the nucleation core of TiN and MnS inclusions in steel, and then form LaAlO3-TiN and LaAlO3-MnS-TiN composite inclusions, which are smaller in size and more uniform in distribution than TiN and sulfide in steel before La element is added. When La is added alone, the average size of TiN inclusion in steel is 2.2 m. After the deoxidation of Al-La alloy, the average size of TiN inclusion in the steel is 1.9 m. After Al-La composite deoxidation, the TiN containing inclusions in the steel will be transformed into smaller LaAlO3-TiN composite inclusions. When adding La alone, the average size of sulfide inclusions in the steel is 2.1 m.

Based on the different deoxidization processes of GCr15 bearing steel produced by a domestic steel plant, the single deoxidization curves of Al, Si, and Mn and the compound deoxidization curves of Al-Si and Si-Mn under pure molten iron and GCr15 bearing steel production conditions were calculated with the FactSage 8.1 thermodynamic software. The results show that the deoxidization curves under the two conditions are quite different. At the same time, the Al-Ti deoxidation equilibrium curve under the condition of GCr15 bearing steel was calculated. It was found that when Ti 0.0015% in the steel, the equilibrium deoxidation product was Al2O3, and no titanium oxide was generated. Finally, a thermodynamic calculation and analysis of the effect of rare-earth Ce content on the modification of inclusions in GCr15 bearing steel were carried out. The results showed that when T 1873 K, the rare-earth Ce treatment of aluminum deoxidized the GCr15 bearing steel; when Al 0.015%, Al2O3 inclusions increased with the increase in Ce content, and the evolution path was Al11O18Ce→CeAlO3→Ce2O3.

Metal fatigue strongly depends on size and shape of non-metallic inclusions and pores, commonly referred to as defects . Nodular cast iron (NCI) contains graphite inclusions (nodules) whose shape and frequency influence the fatigue strength. Fatigue strength can be simulated by micromechanical finite element models. The drawback of these models are the large computational costs. Therefore, we employ a data-driven machine learning methodology. More precisely, we utilize the simplified residual neural network (SimResNet) which was recently introduced (Herty et al., Kinetic Theory for Residual Neural Networks, 2020) to predict fatigue strength from metallographic data. For the training, we use fatigue data which is simulated with a micromechanical model and the shakedown theorem. The micromechanical models are derived directly from micrographs of nodular cast iron, respectively. The application of SimResNet shows a good performance to predict fatigue strength by local microstructures of nodular cast iron. We show several test cases. The simplified character of SimResNet enables fast predictions of fatigue by microstructures, even in comparision to classical residual neural networks.

The oxides serve dual roles, both as components of refractory materials in submerged entry nozzles and also as significant constituents of non-metallic inclusions in the melt. It is therefore crucial to understand the physicochemical interplay between the liquid and the oxides in order to address the nozzle clogging challenges, and thereby optimize cast iron and steel production. This paper presents a methodology for describing these interactions by combining the materials dielectric responses, computed within the density functional theory, with the Casimir-Lifshitz dispersion forces to generate the Hamaker constants. The approach provides a comprehensive understanding of the wettability of iron against these refractory oxides, revealing the complex relation between molecular and macroscopic properties. Our theoretically determined crystalline structures are confirmed by room-temperature X-ray diffraction, and the contact angles of liquid iron on the oxides are validated with a sessile drop system at the temperature 1823 K. For comparison, we also present the wettability of the oxides by a liquid tin-bismuth alloy. The findings are essential in advancing the fundamental understanding of interfacial interactions in metallurgical science, and are also pivotal in driving the development of more efficient and reliable steelmaking processes.

This includes the discussion of the thermodynamics of inclusion formation and the current knowledge on the effects of melt shop processing variable on NMIs composition, amount and size distribution. The development of inclusion engineering tailoring the process to obtain the desired NMIs is highlighted and the development in selected areas tire cord, springs and bearing steels as well as prevention of nozzle clogging is used to illustrate this development.

The relationship between the transformed acicular ferrite, the inclusions, and the chemical nature of the inclusions which had actually nucleated ferrite laths was examined in detail. By employing weld metals with either intermediate (200 350 ppm) or low (15 30 ppm) oxygen levels, the inclusion chemistry and nucleation behaviour of acicular ferrite in welds with different oxygen contents were compared. In addition, the influence of the Al / O ratio in lower oxygen content weld metals was also examined. It was found that the first acicular ferrite laths nucleated from the inclusions at both oxygen levels, and the chemical composition of the active inclusions varied considerably. The inclusions nucleated acicular ferrite by acting simply as inert substrates with the ability to reduce the free energy barrier to nucleation. The number and size distribution of the inclusions appeared to be the dominant factors; the thermal stress-strain fields and lattice disregistry were less important. The most favourable type of inclusions were within the size range 0 3 0 9 m for the higher oxygen content weld metals and 0 35 0 75 m for the lower oxygen level weld metals. A high Al / O ratio depresses the formation of acicular ferrite by increasing the soluble matrix aluminium content, which encourages extensive ferrite sideplate formation; the concurrent variation in inclusion chemical composition did not appear to influence the nucleation of acicular ferrite.MST/3209 Authors: Z.

With reaction time extended from 30 to 180 min, solid MgO Al2O3 and MgO-based inclusions were finally changed into CaO MgO Al2O3 system inclusions lower melting temperature ( 1773 K). While shapes of inclusions varied in the route blocky/angular→near spherical→spherical.Al2O3/MgO Al2O3/MgO and MgO/MgO Al2O3/CaO 2Al2O3 stability diagram were obtained by thermodynamic calculation. The results indicated that MgO and MgO Al2O3 inclusion would be formed at early stage of steel-slag reaction because activity of Mg is much larger than that of Ca in steel. However, with increase of Ca activity, solid MgO Al2O3 and MgO inclusions would be inevitably and gradually transferred into complex liquid inclusions even dissolved Ca is as low as 0.0002%. Thus, SEM-EDS mappings of CaO MgO Al2O3 system inclusions are characterized by high melting temperature solid MgO Al2O3 or MgO-based inclusion cores surrounded by lower melting temperature CaO Al2O3 outer surface layers, which would be softer during hot rolling and therefore be helpful to improve anti-fatigue properties of steel.Model was established to elucidate change mechanisms of inclusions. Transferring kinetics of inclusions was discussed qualitatively to analyze velocity controlled steps. It is found that diffusion of Mg and Ca in solid inclusion core and the formed CaO Al2O3 outer surface layer would be probably the limited step during evolution of inclusions.

It is found that during the tapping process, Al O deoxidization reaction is very close to equilibrium with the formation of many Al2O3 clusters. With the slag/steel reaction, inclusions vary with the route as Al2O3 inclusions→MgO Al2O3 system inclusions→CaO MgO Al2O3 system inclusions, and finally change into globular inclusions surrounded by CaO Al2O3 outer layer, of which the melting point is lower than liquid steel temperature. Since MgO is less stable than CaO and it is easier to be reduced by Al, dissolved Mg is generated earlier and faster than Ca before LF refining, thus the MgO Al2O3 system inclusions form at first. The mapping photos of inclusions show that the evolution mechanism of MgO Al2O3 system inclusions into CaO MgO Al2O3 system inclusions is Ca element substitution for Mg element in MgO Al2O3 inclusions. The line scanning shows that there is also the reaction of Ca element substitution for Al element in the outer CaO Al2O3 layer without MgO.

Both the commercial-quality 440 MPa-class plain carbon steel and super ultra-low carbon steel were studied. To investigate the distribution, morphology, and chemical composition, along with the change in such characteristics, during the hot deformation of non-metallic inclusions, thermo-mechanical treatment with a compression test was carried out. Moreover, the reduction of area with the tensile test species, which refers to the local ductility of steel, was examined, and the effect of the distribution, morphology, and chemical compositions of both the Al2O3 inclusions and the elongated MnS inclusions were studied.Consequently, metal sulfur content of higher than 60 ppm and elongated MnS inclusions of over 10 regarding the aspect ratio were observed. In addition, the elongated MnS inclusions had a stronger influence on local ductility than the smaller Al2O3 inclusions, and drastic effects on the nucleation of voids. Thus, a fracture is most likely to be initiated by void formation at the interface of the elongated MnS inclusions and metal matrix notched by MnS, and thus would experience coalescence in accordance with a brittle fracture in the soft MnS inclusions. The local ductility in steel including elongated MnS inclusions is small because the fracturing and deformation of metal are most likely to be related to the elongated MnS inclusions.

The present work investigates endogenous inclusions formed in Fe 25Mn 3Si 3Al TWIP steels in laboratorial ingot, mold casting after AOD steelmaking and electroslag remelting (ESR) process at industrial plant, respectively. The research shows that AlN and Al2O3 inclusions are found as dominating inclusions, and most of them are AlN, but the number, distribution, size shape of inclusions have big differences in different metallurgical processes. The AlN inclusions in laboratorial ingot mainly present cluster states and have larger size, but after AOD or ESR process most of AlN inclusions are uniformly distributed, this would reduce harm to steel quality. From the point of view of thermodynamics, the research finds that the generation of AlN inclusions in Fe 25Mn 3Si 3Al steels is different from that of most of other high-Al steels or Al-killed steels, because many publications reported that the precipitation of AlN inclusions took place at solidifying front or solid phase, but AlN inclusions formed in Fe 25Mn 3Si 3Al steels generate in liquid steel, and related experimental results prove this point.

Steel samples were taken at various stages of the process and from ladles of different ages. Inclusion numbers were counted under an optical microscope. It was found that the total number of inclusions increased with the ladle age before deoxidation and at the end of the ladle treatment. The increase was substantial after the ladle had been used more than 18 times. Inclusions having the smallest sizes were found to make a large contribution to this increase. This observation was further confirmed by the difference between total oxygen content and dissolved oxygen content in the steel samples, which also showed an increase with ladle age. Analysis by SEM EDX revealed two types of inclusions before casting, namely, inclusions consisting only of an oxide solution having a composition very close to 3CaO. Al2O3, and inclusions consisting of the same oxide solution as well as MgO phase. This finding was in accordance with the reported result that both 3CaO.

It was found that, when the casting speed was evenly decreased from 1.4 to 0.6 m/min, increases of the nonmetallic inclusions owing to the increase of the mold powder entrapment were observed only on those slabs which were cast at the start of casting speed change. While, in experiment of increasing casting speed evenly from 0.6 to 1.4 m/min, increases of nonmetallic inclusions were observed only on slabs which are cast at the time when the casting speed was stopped to increase after it had been increased to 1.4 m/min. For slabs which were cast during the casting speed evenly increasing or decreasing period and at the time when increasing or decreasing the casting speed at low casting speed level (0.6 m/min), the influence of casting speed change was very small. In addition, it was found that, at high casting speed level (1.4 m/min), even a little change of casting speed could result in remarkable increase of the non-metallic inclusions. Thus, at high casting speed, changing casting speed should be avoided or using much slower speed changing rate.

The steel/slag reaction time and Al 2 O 3 content in slag had a great effect on inclusions characteristics.

Formation and transformation mechanisms of the inclusions were given based on the results. It was also found that with Al 2 O 3 content in slag reduced from 40% to 30%, Mg contents in steel melts were increased and MgO in slag reached saturation, which contributed to the formation of more MgO based inclusions and a more scattered inclusion composition distribution after 90 min reaction.

The influence of reheating temperature, in the range 1000 1250°C, and finish rolling temperature (starting cooling temperature), in the range 800 1000°C, was also studied. Interrupted accelerated cooling caused a double enhancement of grain refinement and an increase of precipitation strengthening resulting in increases of yield strength up to 750 MN m 2 and elongations greater than 25%. Increasing the reheating temperature to 1100 and 1250°C for V and Ti steels, respectively, enhanced the increment of precipitation strengthening due to accelerated cooling, but had no effect on grain refinement. Interrupted accelerated cooling was found to be most effective for improving yield strength when it is started at higher temperatures in the region. Accelerated cooling effectively inhibited bainite formation and produced very fine grain size at high finish rolling temperatures. This technique is therefore very attractive for processing of microalloyed steels because of the possibility of attaining very fine grains without decreasing the finish rolling temperature, thus reducing the process time.MST/1180 Authors: Mohamed F.

The final compression temperature strongly influenced the order of SIP and SRX and thus the evolution of the austenite structure. Precipitation-time-temperature (PTT) curve obtained for the experimental steel exhibited an inverted S shape. A recrystallisation kinetics model revealed that SRX, which occurs preferentially above 940 °C, resulted in delayed subsequent SIP, thus causing deviation in the PTT curve from the typical C shape. Below 940 °C, the fastest nose temperature for precipitation was located at 900 °C, and the precipitate was constituted by TiC particles with a NaCl-type FCC structure. The dynamic competition between SIP and SRX processes were evaluated by comparing the relative magnitude of the recrystallisation driving force and precipitation pinning force during stress relaxation, combined with the evolution of precipitate and austenitic structure. The results indicated that the plateau period occurred because of the precipitation pinning effect inhibited recrystallisation-induced austenite softening. However, the non-uniform distribution of SIP restricted the mobility of the boundaries to a portion of the austenite grains, resulting in abnormal grain growth during the plateau period.

These steels are often used as better alternatives for quenched and tempered steels due to the excellent combination of these properties. The beneficial properties in these steels are achieved by careful control of composition and by adopting suitably controlled thermomechanical processing (TMCP). Improved weldability is achieved by maintaining carbon at lower level. To compensate the effect of carbon, small amounts of alloying elements, such as niobium, vanadium, titanium, aluminium, and nitrogen are added. Though these steels have good weldability, they suffer from hydrogen induced cracking especially at high strength levels. In the present study, hydrogen induced cracking susceptibility of a newly developed indigenous vanadium titanium microalloyed high strength steel was evaluated by means of implant cracking test. Welding was carried out using the GMAW process at different heat input levels. It was found that the coarse-grained heat affected zone (CGHAZ) of the steel is prone for hydrogen induced cracking at lower heat inputs. The implant test results indicated that the critical stress level increases with increasing heat inputs. The results were correlated with the microstructural modifications that occur in the CGHAZ at different welding conditions. The microhardness variations in that region were in good agreement with the observed results.

Microalloyed steels benefit from vanadium and niobium additions, but the carbonitrides formed by these elements are not stable at high temperatures. Micro-additions of titanium, which form a fine dispersion of carbonitrides that are stable at high temperature, have been promoted as an approach fox maintaining a fine austenite grain size at high forging temperatures. In this work two microalloyed steels were examined, 1522MoV and 1522MoV with 0.011 titanium addition. The effect of the titanium additions on the grain size and high temperature flow strength were studied. The titanium addition has a significant effect on maintaining a small austenite grain size at temperatures up to 1300°C. High temperature stress-strain data indicate that titanium causes an increased flow strength at 1100°C and 1200°C especially at higher strain rates.

The static recrystallization fractions were calculated by the stress offset method and static recrystallization diagrams for the tested steels were obtained. The effects of deformation temperature and interval time on the softening behaviors were analyzed. Especially, the effect of nitrogen on the softening behaviors of the tested steels is discussed in detail. The results showed that the softening behaviors of the tested steels with various nitrogen contents are different. As far as the steel with low nitrogen content is concerned, the softening fraction increases monotonically with increasing time interval, and higher temperature can promote the static recrystallization. However, with more nitrogen added into vanadium titanium microalloyed steel, precipitated particles of vanadium titanium carbonitride can be observed in the tested steel at the temperature of 850 °C or 800 °C, which leads to the formation of plateaus on the softening curves. An increase in nitrogen content in the steel is favorable for vanadium titanium carbonitride precipitation, which leads to a stronger prohibition of static recrystallization and a longer plateau on the softening curves. Moreover, the precipitated particles in the tested steel will not play an inhibition role in static recrystallization until the nitrogen content in the steel reaches a critical value.

The results showed that the ranges of transformation products were moved to the right side of the CCT diagram when the 0.4% W was added. Accordingly, the following observations were made: (i) the ferrite phase transformation was shifted to the side of lower cooling rates and reduced temperatures; (ii) the bainite phase transformation region ran throughout the whole cooling rate range studied. Addition of W had a positive effect on the particle size refinement and number density increase of the precipitates. At the low cooling rates, in the range of lt;14 °C/s, W addition shifted the precipitation hardening peak to the low cooling rate side as the ferrite transformation induced stronger precipitation strengthening than the bainite one.

Abstract: A theoretical model is presented in this work to calculate the evolution of austenite-to-allotriomorphic and idiamorphic ferrite transformation as a function of time in medium carbon vanadium-titanium microalloyed steel. At temperatures above the eutectoid temperature where allotriomorphic ferrite is the only austenite transformation product, the soft-impingement effect should be taken into account in the modelling. By contrast, at temperatures below the eutectoid temperature, the formation of pearlite avoids the carbon enrichment of austenite due to the previous ferrite formation, and therefore carbon concentration in austenite far from the / interface remains the same as the overall carbon content of the steel. Hence, the soft-impingement effect should be neglected, and allotriomorphic and idiomorphic ferrite is considered to grow under a parabolic law. The nature, size and distribution of the inclusions which are responsible of the intra-granular nucleation of idiomorphic ferrite have been considered in this study.

This is due to the fact that steels with improved mechanical and operational properties are of great significance in the current situation of technology development. The studies are based on a comparison of the mechanical properties of known steel grades 2 and T, experimental industrial steel grade K and steels microalloyed with complexes aluminum, titanium and nitrogen; aluminum and nitrogen of steel grade K. Metallographic analysis, determination of mechanical properties, chemical analysis and X-ray microanalysis are used. It is shown that complex microalloying with aluminum, titanium and nitrogen; aluminum and nitrogen of K grade steel contributes to the formation of a more fine-grained structure of pearlite and inclusions, compared to steel grades 2, T and K. In the structure of K steel, which is microalloyed with aluminum, titanium, and nitrogen, after casting, the formation of oxides, nitrides, carbonitrides, and multilayer inclusions located at the grain boundaries and in the grain volume is observed. After a full cycle of deformation and heat treatment, carbides, nitrides, and titanium carbonitrides remain in the steel structure. Whereas in steel, which is additionally microalloyed with aluminum and nitrogen on the basis of K steel, after solidification, a fine-grained structure with an increased volume fraction of pearlite is formed, the formation of inclusions of oxides, monosilicides of manganese and iron; sulfides and complex carbides in comparison with known steel grades K, 2 and T occurs.

The purpose of this study is to mitigate the formation of brittle phases during the laser welding of dissimilar Ti/Al metals, thereby enhancing the mechanical properties of the joints. In this investigation, an innovative approach is adopted, utilizing Nb foil as an interlayer to effectively minimize the formation of brittle intermetallic phases during dissimilar welding. A comprehensive analysis of the microstructure of the transition layer was conducted using material characterization methods, including scanning electron microscope equipped with an energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer. The mechanical performance of the welded joints was assessed using tensile testing. The results indicate that the effective welding width and joint penetration depth at the joint interface were reduced in Ti/Al dissimilar metals when Nb was added as an intermediate layer, under the same welding process parameters, when compared to unalloyed weld seams. Furthermore, the utilization of a 0.05 mm Nb foil as the intermediate layer results in a significant 25% increase in the average shear strength compared to the other condition, with the average shear strength of the joint reaching its peak value at 192 N/mm. The unalloyed Ti/Al weld joint usually fractured along the melting zone, displaying complete brittle fracture characteristics. After Nb microalloying, the joint typically fractures along the transition zone and interface, exhibiting both cleavage and ductile fracture characteristics, indicating the combination of a brittle and toughness fracture. This study provides experimental evidence and new insights for welding Ti/Al composite structures, with significant theoretical and practical applications. Authors: Hao Pan, Yue Wang, S.

Although the strengthening mechanisms and microalloying effects of Nb, V, and Ti in low carbon steels have been extensively studied, those in high carbon steels are underresearched. This knowledge gap primarily arises from the substantial effect of high carbon content on phase transformations, precipitation behavior, and the thermodynamic solubility of microalloying elements. To advance the application of microalloying in high carbon steels, this review systematically summarizes recent progress in the utilization of Nb, V, and Ti in high carbon steels. The primary strengthening mechanisms, including grain refinement strengthening and precipitation strengthening, are thoroughly discussed for each microalloying element, along with their respective effects on mechanical properties. Furthermore, the solubilities of these elements in high carbon and low carbon steels are compared, emphasizing the challenges in accurately predicting solubility limits. Additionally, the impacts of microalloying elements on the critical properties of steel, such as wear resistance and corrosion behavior, are also reviewed. Finally, key challenges and future research directions are identified to guide further advancements in the field.

Efficient prediction of grade intermixing during ladle changeover operations is critical for maintaining steel quality and minimizing material losses in the continuous casting process. Among various factors influencing grade intermixing, operating parameters play a significant role, in addition to tundish geometry and flow control devices. In this study, three-dimensional, transient, two-phase turbulent flow simulations are conducted to investigate the ladle changeover operation. During this process, the molten steel level in the tundish typically varies over time, significantly affecting the grade intermixing phenomena. The influence of ladle change time on intermixing time has been presented. However, high-fidelity full-order simulations of such complex transient phenomena are computationally expensive and are impractical for real-time monitoring or design-space exploration in industrial-scale applications. To address this issue, a reduced order modelling approach based on proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) and reservoir computing (RC) is employed to efficiently predict intermixing time. The proposed reduced order model (ROM) demonstrates excellent predictive accuracy using limited training data while requiring significantly less computational resources and training time. The results demonstrate the potential of the proposed methodology as a fast, reliable tool for real-time process monitoring and optimization in industrial continuous casting operations.

Then, we plant the heat flux estimation problem as the inverse problem of estimating a Neumann boundary condition having as data pointwise temperature measurements in the interior of the mold domain. We also consider the case of having a total heat flux measurement together with the temperature measurements. We develop two methodologies for solving this inverse problem.

The results show that the parameterization method outclasses Alifanov s regularization both in performance and computational cost.

This study investigates the fluid flow behaviour in a single-strand tundish using numerical and experimental approaches. Full-order model (FOM) steady-state simulations were conducted under both isothermal and non-isothermal conditions to assess the influence of thermal buoyancy on the flow characteristics. The results show that buoyancy effects under non-isothermal conditions have a negligible impact on the overall velocity field. The converged flow fields serve as initial conditions for transient tracer transport simulations, enabling evaluation of RTD curves and volume partitioning. A Galerkin projection-based reduced-order model (ROM) is developed to efficiently derive RTD curves. Comparison of RTD curves from experiments, FOM simulations, and ROM predictions demonstrates strong agreement, with both computational approaches closely matching experimental data. A parameter-time dependent ROM is subsequently developed using Galerkin projection and operator interpolation. This enables efficient evaluation of RTD curves across varying parameter values with significantly reduced computational cost compared to full-order simulations. The ROM framework is well-suited for real-time analysis, design processes, optimization, and digital twin applications in metallurgical processes.

Efficient scheduling not only enhances productivity but also significantly reduces energy consumption. However, both traditional heuristics (e.g., two-stage local search) and recent metaheuristics often struggle to adapt to the dynamic characteristics of practical SCCSP instances. To address these limitations, this paper introduces a novel Q learning based hierarchical cooperative local search framework, termed HierC Q, aimed at minimizing the weighted sum of the maximum completion time and the average waiting time in SCCSP. The core contributions of HierC Q are twofold. First, considering the intrinsic coupling properties of the SCCSP, a dedicated reward function is proposed based on a novel coupling measure (CM), guiding the exploration process towards promising regions of the solution space. Second, a hierarchical architecture is devised, comprising two distinct tiers: the learn to improve (L2I) tier and the disturb to renovate (D2R) tier. The L2I tier performs deep exploitation within promising regions using two independent Q-learning-based local search frameworks (QLSFs) tailored for subproblems, along with a synergy QLSF designed for the main problem. To enhance the effectiveness of local search, a validity evaluation approach and a speed-up evaluation method are also intro-duced, grounded in a detailed study of the problem s structure. Meanwhile, the D2R tier incorporates a perturbation and construction based solution renewal strategy to mitigate the risk of premature convergence. The superiority and effectiveness of HierC Q are demonstrated through extensive comparisons with eleven local search frameworks and nine state-of-the-art algorithms.

This approach is incorporated with Radial Basis Functions not only to lessen the size of unknown inputs but also to mitigate the computational burden of this technique.

Thanks to this microstructure, the resulting composites achieve enhanced mechanical and functional properties. However, parts with complex geometry require their microstructure to be specifically tuned and controlled locally in 3D. Although the tunability of the microstructure along the vertical direction has already been demonstrated using magnetic orientation combined with sequential or continuous casting, controlling the particle orientation in the horizontal plane in a fast and effective fashion remains challenging.

We experimentally studied the orientation of the flakes in response to magnets rotating at various frequencies and precessing angles. Then, we used COMSOL to model the magnetic field from rotating magnetic arrays and predicted the resulting in-plane orientations. To validate the approach, we created composites with locally oriented flakes.

These pores are nuclei for ductile damage and need to be closed during rolling in regard of the strict performance requirements of todays advanced high strength steels. Due to the beneficial shape factor of the roll gap, recrystallization and high diffusion rates pore closure and elimination occurs primarily during hot rolling. In this paper, relevant influencing factors on pore closure are investigated based on representative volume elements (RVE). First, the load regime of typical multi-pass hot rolling schedules is calculated via macro scale FEM and then applied to micro scale RVEs. Within the RVE, shape changes of a given pore are tracked and the closure ratio is calculated. This paper elucidates the effect of different roll diameters, absolute reductions per pass, pore shape and pore orientation on the closure rate. The results show that the majority of pores can be closed during the initial hot rolling stages. However, pore closure can be accelerated through suitable process parameters. Furthermore, shape and orientation of pores should be taken into account, if a precise knowledge of the total height reduction, leading to complete pore closure, is desired.

Linear stability analysis and direct numerical simulations (DNS) are conducted, using the spectral element method to identify observable states. The nature of the bifurcations is determined through Stuart--Landau analysis for completeness. The base flow consists of two counter-rotating rolls driven by the baroclinic imbalance due to the curved isothermal boundary. These are however suppressed by the through-flow, which is found to have a stabilising influence as soon as the Reynolds number based on the through-flow exceeds 25. For a sufficiently high Rayleigh number, this base flow is linearly unstable to three different modes, depending on .

This configuration models the continuous casting of metallic alloys, where hot liquid metal is poured at the top of a hot sump with cold walls pulled in a solid phase at the bottom. The model focuses on the underlying fundamental thermo-hydrodynamic processes without dealing with the complexity inherent to the real configuration (Flood amp; Davidson 1994). This flow exhibits three branches of instability (Kumar amp; Poth rat 2020). The solution of the adjoint eigenvalue problem for the convective flow equations reveals that the regions of highest receptivity for unstable modes of each branch concentrate near the inflow upper surface. Simulations of the linearised governing equations show that a thermo-mechanical actuation modelled on the adjoint eigenmode asymptotically suppresses the unstable mode. If the actuation s amplitude is kept constant in time, which is easier to implement in an industrial environment, the suppression is still effective but only over a finite time, after which it becomes destabilising. Based on this phenomenology, we apply the same actuation during the stabilising phase only in the nonlinear evolution of the unstable mode. It turns out stabilisation persists, even when the unstable mode is left to evolve freely after the actuation period. These results not only demonstrate the effectiveness of receptivity-informed actuation in stabilising convective oscillations but also suggest a simple strategy for their long-term control.

Models to predict hot ductility behaviour have been discussed and the parts of the trough which can be used to predict the likelihood of cracking occurring are highlighted. On tensile testing both deformation induced ferrite in sufficient quantity to improve ductility and dynamic recrystallisation occur but not when straightening during continuous casting; the strain being too low. This limits the use of the hot ductility curve in predicting cracking behaviour. The temperature range in which straightening of the continuously cast strand should be carried out is either 30°C below the Ar 3 when there is a large amount of ferrite ( 40%) present before deformation or above the T d, the temperature at which dynamic recrystallisation starts to take place in a tensile test; this being when the ferrite film no longer forms and precipitates are sufficiently coarse and few in number to influence the ductility. The influence of C,Mn,N, Nb,V,B,Ti,Al and the residuals Cu and Sn on hot ductility are examined and recommendations made with regard to the amounts and cooling conditions required to give freedom from transverse and edge cracks. The hot ductility of the new transformation induced plasticity (TRIP) and twin induced plasticity (TWIP) steels has also been reviewed. P has been shown to have little influence on the hot ductility, but for Al based TRIP and TWIP steels, Al levels need to be closely controlled and high Al levels, (1 5 to 2%Al) are favoured.Keywords: Hot ductilityTransverse crackingContinuous castingBTiNNbAlCuSn additionsReview Authors: B.

Three distinct ranges of behaviour are displayed: (a) a high ductility, low temperature range which results from the presence of a large volume fraction of the more ductile ferrite phase; (b) a high temperature ductile region covering the range within which grain boundary particles are dissolved and boundaries are able to migrate so that any initiated cracks are prevented from linking up and enlarging; and (c) a trough between these two ranges in which low ductility intergranular failures often occur. These intergranular failures arise as a result of stress and strain concentrations at the austenite boundaries caused either by the presence of thin films of the softer deformation induced ferrite enveloping the austenite grains, or by grain boundary sliding in the austenite. Both failure mechanisms are encouraged by the presence of grain boundary precipitates and inclusions (the finer, the more detrimental), coarser grain sizes, and lower strain rates. The factors which control intergranular failure are analysed, leading to estimates of both the width and depth of the trough. The relation between the hot ductility behaviour in tensile testing and the occurrence of transverse cracking in straightening operations is discussed. It is shown that information from hot ductility tests can be used to predict the likelihood of transverse cracking because the variables that influence the depth of the ductility trough are also responsible for transverse cracking. The steps that can be taken to reduce the incidence of transverse cracking are considered in detail: these include adjustments to the chemical composition, grain size reductions, and control of the volume fraction and size distribution of the inclusions and precipitates. In terms of continuous casting process variables, control of the secondary cooling flow is probably most effective in reducing transverse cracking. Authors: B. Mintz, S. Yue, J. J.

Towards these goals, numerous physical and mathematical modelling studies embodying both industrial and water model tundishes have been carried out and reported in the literature. Based on an extensive literature search, we now present a summary, discussion and analysis of these. For the sake of convenience and clarity of presentation, the studies have been categorised into three major groups: (1) physical modelling (2) mathematical modelling and (3) combined physical and mathematical modelling. In each of these categories, a great number of publications on various aspects of tundish metallurgy, such as, modelling criteria, turbulent fluid flow, residence time distributions (RTD), inclusion transport and separation, heat loss and temperature drop, grade transition and intermixing, etc. have been reported. These works have lead to considerable improvements in our understanding of the various transport processes (viz, RTD, inclusion float out, thermal energy transport, etc.) associated with tundish operations.

We model the problem considering the constraints of the practical technological requirements and the dynamic nature. To solve the SCC scheduling problem, we propose an improved differential evolution (DE) algorithm with a real-coded matrix representation for each individual of the population, a two-step method for generating the initial population, and a new mutation strategy. To further improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the solution process for dynamic use, an incremental mechanism is proposed to generate a new initial population for the DE whenever a real-time event arises, based on the final population in the last DE solution process. Computational experiments on randomly generated instances and the practical production data show that the proposed improved algorithm can obtain better solutions compared to other algorithms.

Abstract: Heat transfer in continuous casting mold is important to decide the surface quality of the cast slab of middle carbon steel. Many researchers have recently studied the mechanism of reducing the heat transfer between the mold and the solidified shell, and some of them have pointed out that the interfacial thermal resistance between the mold and surface of solidified mold flux has caused decreasing heat transfer. In the present study, the surface roughness of solidified mold fluxes used for low carbon and middle carbon steel casting, Na2O-CaO-SiO2 and Li2O-CaO-SiO2 slag systems, was measured by a confocal scanning laser microscope combined with an infrared image furnace. It was found that the surface roughness was in the range of approximately 10-30 m when the crystalline phase precipitated. Furthermore, the faster the cooling rate, the smoother the surface roughness of the solidified mold flux became. In the contrast, the surface roughness of the slag, of which critical cooling rate is faster, increased. The surface roughness of the mold flux for middle carbon steel casting became rougher than that for low carbon steel casting. As a result, the surface roughness was related to normalized cooling rate, which is the ratio of actual experimental cooling rate to critical cooling rate. The experimental data of surface roughness were fairly in agreement with calculated values on the assumption of one dimensional heat transfer in the continuous casting mold. Authors: K.

Abstract: The conditions under which crystallization develops in a mold slag must be understood in order to select or design a mold flux for use in the continuous casting of steels. In this paper, the crystallization of an industrial mold slag was quantified using a single hot thermocouple technique which, when combined with a video camera based observation system, allowed observation of the onset and growth of the crystals which were precipitated from the melt. The beginning of crystallization was determined by direct observation and the growth rate of crystals were measured by frame by frame image analysis of recordings of the progress of crystallization. Isothermal experiments were performed at different temperatures and a Time-Temperature-Transformation (TTT) diagram was determined for this industrial mold slag. X-ray diffraction of quenched samples was used to determine the type of crystalline phases that were precipitated. The TTT diagram was divided into two separate regions which corresponded to the precipitation of dicalcium silicate (Ca2SiO4) at temperatures over 1050°C and of Cuspidine (Ca4Si2O7F2) at temperatures below 1050°C. The evolution crystal fraction was described by Avrami s equation. This work indicates that industrial mold slags are easily undercooled, that crystallization occurs throughout the melt, that crystals grow initially as equiaxed dendrites and that the onset of crystallization is a function of cooling rate and must be described by either TTT or CCT curves.

Abstract: Heat transfer from solidifying shell to mold near the meniscus plays an important role for the formation of surface cracks on continuously cast steel products. The heat transfer is influenced substantially by the thermal resistance at the interface between mold flux film and copper mold. Accordingly, a model system consisting of steel shell/mold flux film/copper mold is built to simulate the heat transfer near the meniscus in the mold for continuous casting, and the thermal resistance is determined by measuring temperature gradient in the copper mold in the simulator. The interfacial thermal resistance increases with increasing flux film thickness in contrast to previous observation by others who assumed that the interfacial thermal resistance is constant for different flux film thickness. The interfacial thermal resistance is found to be about 50% of overall thermal resistance for the heat transfer. Mold fluxes for medium carbon steel with higher crystallization temperatures show lower heat flux than those for low carbon steel not due to reduced radiative heat transfer but due to higher interfacial thermal resistance at the same flux film thickness. This arises from the difference in crystallizing behavior such as growth rate of crystalline layer between the two fluxes.

Many product defects are controlled by flow-related phenomena in the mold region, such as slag entrapment due to excessive surface velocity and level fluctuations, meniscus hook defects due to insufficient transport of flow and superheat to the meniscus region, and particle entrapment into the solidification front, which depends on transverse flow across the dendritic interface. Fluid flow also affects heat transfer, solidification, and solute transport, which greatly affect grain structure and internal quality of final steel products. Various electromagnetic systems can affect flow, including static magnetic fields and traveling fields which actively accelerate, slow down, or stir the flow in the mold or strand regions. Optimal electromagnetic effects to control flow depends greatly on the caster geometry and other operating conditions.

An interfacial thermal resistance corresponding to the air gap of 20-50 m is observed in the case of solid mold flux. When the temperature of the mold surface exceeds solidification temperature of the flux, the interfacial thermal resistance disappears together with disappearance of air gaps. The crystallization of the mold flux inhibits the radiative heat transfer that is equivalent to 20% in the total heat flux.

Abstract: This paper first reviews the current state-of-the-art in the evaluation of steel cleanliness, discussing over 20 different methods. The demand for cleaner steels requires lowering non-metallic oxide inclusions and also controlling their morphology, composition and size distribution. Because no single method can measure all of these aspects accurately, it is best to combine several methods together to quantify steel cleanliness in a given operation. Owing to the cost, time requirements, and sampling difficulties, steel cleanliness is widely inferred using total oxygen, nitrogen pick-up, and other indirect methods. Recent cleanliness values using these indicators are summarized for LCAK at many steel plants around the world. Secondly, this paper reviews operating practices to improve steel cleanliness at the ladle, tundish and continuous caster, emphasizing findings quantified with plant measurements. Inclusions come from many sources, including deoxidation, reoxidation, slag entrapment, refractory wear, and chemical reactions. They generate many defects such as cracks and slivers in the steel product. Steel cleanliness is controlled by attention to a wide range of important operating conditions throughout the steelmaking and casting processes. For ladle operations, FeO and MnO in the slag, ladle treatments, and inclusion modification are discussed. For tundish operations, tundish depth and capacity, casting transitions, refractory lining, tundish flux; gas stirring, and flow controls are discussed. Important transfer operations from ladle to tundish and from tundish to mold, such as argon protection, sealing issues, and SEN clogging are summarized. Caster operations reviewed include the effect of casting speed, fluid flow pattern control, surface level control, and caster curvature. Authors: Lifeng Zhang, Brian G.

These impurities are linked to the ferroalloy manufacturing route. The inclusions observed in the microstructure are in good agreement with the inclusions extracted by the dissolution technique.

In particular, non-metallic inclusions affect steel cleanliness and cause defects leading to worsening of desired mechanical properties and service life of steel products. Other detrimental effects of inclusions are poor steel castability often resulting in slab downgrades and rejections, increased costs associated with recycling of liquid steel and refractories, and even shut down of the caster. Inclusion engineering is thus important to achieve process and quality control on a daily production basis.

The steel cleanliness in terms of inclusion number density, size and size distribution was evaluated. It was found that the reducible component, low-melting-point phases and the pores in GM were passageway for steel penetration. The Al 2 O 3 GM was less prone to steel penetration due to its poor wetting and the dense transition layer. MgO GM provided more oxygen and showed a stronger oxidizing capacity due to its higher content of reducible oxides (10.5 wt.% SiO 2 2 wt.% Fe 2 O 3 ).

In the present work, influence of billet caster up-gradation on the overall cleanliness of high carbon steel has been investigated, mechanical characteristics of oxide inclusions evaluated and assessment of the existing deoxidation practice have been done. In general, there has been improvement in the overall level of steel cleanliness due to increasing tundish capacity, submerge pouring of liquid steel and application of in-mold EMS. These measures have effectively controlled the inclusions originating from reoxidation of liquid steel. However, the characteristics of the oxide inclusions generated during the deoxidation process in ladle remained same even after the caster up-gradation. The conventional deoxidation practice was found to generate mostly inclusions of variable compositions and alumina rich non-deformable inclusions, which makes the steel less suitable for very fine wire drawing applications.

Furthermore, calculations of oxygen activities in the steel melt were made and the results were compared to measurements with varying results.

In order to utilize the maximum productivity of the continuous-casting machine, it is sometimes necessary to cast steel grades with different chemical compositions in one sequence. It is important, therefore, to know the possibilities of a specific continuous-casting machine to make the Intermix connections as short as possible. Any interference with established procedures may, however, have a negative impact on the cleanliness of the cast steel. Using physical and numerical simulation tools, it was found that reducing the steel level in the tundish during the exchange of ladles makes it possible to shorten the transition zone. However, when the steel level is reduced, the flow of steel is impaired, which can have a negative effect on the cleanliness of the cast steel and, in extreme cases, may even lead to entrapment of slag in the mold. The cleanliness of cast steel was evaluated using one of the most advanced tools for automatic steel cleanliness evaluation, AZtecFeature (Oxford Instruments, Abingdon, UK), which enables determination of the type, size, distribution, and shape, as well as the chemical composition, of individual types of non-metal inclusions.

Characteristic, in situ formed layers on the surface of carbon bonded alumina filters result from these interactions. To comprehend their formation, this study illustrates the time dependency of the layer buildup. Therefore, reactions at the filter/steel interface under quasi static conditions are examined using spark plasma sintering (SPS) equipment. Immersion tests in a steel casting simulator, which provides close to reality conditions, complement these investigations. Microstructure and phase analyses reveal that interfacial reactions between filter and steel lead to a thin in situ formed layer on the filter surface. During a reactive stage, large polycrystalline alumina structures are formed. Thereby, material is transported both from the carbon bonded material underneath (i.e., gaseous reaction products) and from the molten steel (i.e., precipitating particles and endogenous inclusions) to the filter/steel interface. The formation of these alumina particles comes to an end as soon as the carbon supply, which triggers the dissolution and precipitation processes at the interface, is cut off. From that point on, endogenous inclusions are deposited on them ( active stage). The filters were most efficient during the reactive stage, that is, as long as the interfacial reactions take place.

This model analyzes distributions of inclusion size, shape, orientation, and location, and computes stress alterations to bearing material due to inclusions and the resulting life reduction. Comparisons between model predictions and experimental test results were made, confirming the validity of the model. Parametric studies were conducted to explore the effects of inclusion counts, inclusion size distributions, and the effect of overall bearing size on bearing life. A regression equation was proposed based on simulation results, linking the bearing life reduction factor (LRF) to the accumulative inclusion length within the stressed volume under contact load.

The main purpose was to study the influence of impurities in the ferroalloys FeTi (FeTi70 and FeTi35) and FeP on steel cleanliness. Therefore, two steel grades ultra low carbon (ULC) high Mn and ULC low Mn to which these ferroalloys are added were chosen for the study. The number of Al based inclusions analysed with pulse discrimination analysis-optical emission spectroscopy was taken as a measure of steel cleanliness and compared using box plot analysis and through a t test for different grades of FeTi additions. The ferroalloy parameters as well as other major process parameters during secondary metallurgy were also correlated to the inclusion number density. The statistical analysis was supplemented with elemental (ferroalloy) recovery calculations based on the industrial data and FactSage, the equilibrium Fe-Al-P-O diagram and the inclusion extraction analysis. On the basis of this study, it is proposed that (1) FeTi70 is a comparatively cleaner ferroalloy than FeTi35 and (2) for FeP in ULC low carbon steel, the best addition practice to maintain a balance between P recovery and steel cleanliness is towards the end of decarburisation and before the addition of Al blocks. 2012 Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining.

Experimental results from water modeling are used to validate the simulated results. Tundish cover powder (TCP) and steel samples are taken from eight heats in one sequence to evaluate the effect of the multiphase flows during ladle change on the composition of the TCPs and steel cleanliness. Furthermore, the effect of the refilling time on the air entrainment and slag aperture during ladle change is analyzed and discussed. It is found that the strong turbulent flows in the tundish impact zone during ladle change promote the mix of the two layer cover powder, which consists of a basic TCP layer at the bottom and a top layer of rice hull balls. It results in a significant change in the composition of the TCPs and gradually deteriorates the steel cleanliness by the slag steel reaction. Increasing the refilling time can effectively decrease the amount of entrained air and area of slag layer aperture in the tundish bath during ladle change. To reduce the steel reoxidation during ladle change, the refilling time should be larger than 184 s. Moreover, a new TCP is developed instead of the top layer of rice hull balls in industrial production. The use of the new TCP significantly improves the steel cleanliness in the tundish.

However, PDA-OES measures only the number of inclusions present in the steel irrespective of size. In the present paper, the potential of PDA to determine the inclusion size is evaluated by employing two methodologies: (i) obtaining the average inclusion size by dividing the difference of total and soluble aluminium concentration by the number of Al based inclusions for 200 industrial ULC heats and (ii) measuring the Al concentration for individual peak intensity for specific heats, giving the inclusion size distribution. The methodologies of inclusion size measurement by PDA-OES as well as the possible causes of the discrepancies obtained after comparison with the inclusion extraction technique are explained in detail. 2011 ISIJ.

Its main function is to remove undesirable gases. However, during this process, flotation phenomenon and inclusions absorption are reported. The aim of the present work was to study the slag viscosity and vacuum degassing (tank type) capacity in steel cleanliness from an industry perspective. To achieve this objective, slag and steel samples were taken before and after the vacuum stage. The results in steel cleanliness were related to a kinetic stirring parameter ( s) of the vacuum station and to the effect of slag viscosity. The removal of inclusions during the vacuum stage reached 64, 75 and 78% in the diameter ranges of 2.5-5, 5-15 and ≥ 15 m, respectively. After the degassing process, the composition of non-metallic inclusions seemed to approach the slags chemical compositions. The stirring process in the vacuum degassing station promotes a significant decrease in the inclusion densities for the 2.5-15 m diameter range and also in the sulfur content in liquid steel. Regarding the effective viscosities of slags, it was concluded that lower values (0.20 Pa.s) increased slag capacity in inclusion removal, whereas higher values ( gt; 0.40 Pa.s) were detrimental to steel cleanliness.

The content of Mg in steel has significant influence on the cleanness of molten steel and microstructure. As the content of Mg increases, the content of O and S in steel decreases significantly, with O content as low as 0.0002% and S content as low as 0.0008%. Almost all inclusions in ultra-high Mg steel are magnesium-bearing oxide, sulfide, even carbide. As the content of Mg increases, the number of inclusions in the steel increases and the size decreases. But if too much Mg is added into the steel, the size and number of inclusions will rapid increase. The as-cast secondary dendrite spacing of steel decreased obviously with the increase of Mg content in steel. As the content of Mg increases, the as-cast microstructure changes from lamellar pearlite to granular pearlite. The phase diagram of SKS51 steel was calculated by Thermal-calc software. The calculated results showed that MgC2 was precipitated in the austenite before the austenite was converted into perlite. MgC2 may become the nuclear core, leading to perlite transformation.

Time to failure vs loading (applied) stress plots were made for three commercially produced heats of steel corresponding to open-hearth quality, aircraft quality, and calcium-aluminum deoxidized steel. This comparative SSC study was conducted at a hardness of 33 HRC achieved by tempering at two different temperatures. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and optical metallographic techniques were used to characterize the hydrogen fracture morphology while the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) technique was used to study the tempering response of the specimens. The study indicated that all three heats of the steel exhibited superior performance in the SCC tests when tempered at 685 C compared to 565 C temper as a result of the changes that occurred in the specimen substructure as revealed by the TEM study. The study also indicated that while the use of cleaner steels certainly improves the SSC resistance of the steel, calcium-aluminum deoxidation practice helps to improve the SSC resistance of the steel as well.

As a consequence, there is a need to study the behavior of solid particles (called inclusions) in liquid steel, responsible for the cleanliness defects observed in steel products. The addition to steel of a deoxidizing element such as aluminum provokes the formation of solid particles (Al2O3). These inclusions have a density smaller than steel so they can be eliminated by flotation and captured by the liquid slag layer on the steel surface. The paper proposes some mechanisms for the formation of inclusion cluster in liquid steel and examines the influence of the wetting condition on inclusion growth, using a cold experiment.

Due to the inhomogeneity of inclusion distribution in the micro-scale, it is not straightforward to quantify the effect of inclusions on fatigue behavior. Various investigations have been performed to correlate the inclusion characteristics, such as inclusion fraction, size, and composition, with fatigue life. However, these studies are generally based on vast types of steels and even for a similar steel grade, the alloy concept and microstructure information can still be of non-negligible difference. For a quantitative analysis of the fatigue life improvement with respect to the inclusion engineering, a systematic and carefully designed study is still needed to explore the engineering dimensions of inclusions. Therefore, in this study, three types of bearing steels with inclusions of the same types, but different sizes and amounts, were produced with 50 kg hot state experiments. The following forging and heat treatment procedures were kept consistent to ensure that the only controlled variable is inclusion. The fatigue properties were compared and the inclusions that triggered the fatigue cracks were analyzed to deduce the critical sizes of inclusions in terms of fatigue failure. The results show that the critical sizes of different inclusion types vary in bearing steels. The critical size of the spinel is 8.5 m and the critical size of the calcium aluminate is 13.5 m under the fatigue stress of 1200 MPa. In addition, with the increase of the cleanliness of bearing steels, the improvement of fatigue properties will reach saturation. Under this condition, further increasing of the cleanliness of the bearing steel will not contribute to the improvement of fatigue property for the investigated alloy and process design.

We find correlations between self reported mental health symptoms, engineering identity, and perceptions of inclusion, and these relationships differ by gender. Lastly, we find that students underrepresented in engineering rate their departments as less diverse than their peers. Conclusions Our results suggest that perceptions of inclusion and engineering identity are related to student mental health, further emphasizing the importance of developing inclusive cultures in engineering programs. The findings suggest that mental health needs greater attention in engineering education, particularly for female and first generation students.

Thus, this steel grade has a wide application potential in different fields of industry. The current work provides a fundamental study of the effect of hot-rolling on the inclusion deformation in MMS including a varied 7 to 9 mass pct Mn. Specifically, the deformation behavior of different types of inclusions ( i.e. , Mn(S,Se), liquid oxide (MnSiO 3 ), MnAl 2 O 4 , and complex oxy-sulfide) was investigated. The results show that both MnSiO 3 and Mn(S,Se) are soft inclusions which are able to be deformed during the hot-rolling process but MnAl 2 O 4 does not. The aspect ratio of soft inclusions increases significantly from as-cast to hot-rolling conditions. When the maximum size of different inclusions is similar, Mn(S,Se) deforms more than MnSiO 3 does. This is due to a joint influence of physical parameters including Young s modulus, coefficient of thermal expansion ( ), etc. However, when the maximum size of one type of inclusion ( e.g., MnSiO 3 ) is much larger than another one ( e.g., Mn(S,Se)), this maximum size of soft inclusions plays a dominant role than other factors. In addition, the deformation behavior of dual-phase inclusion depends on the major phase, i.e. , either oxide or sulfide. Last but not least, empirical correlations between the reduction ratio of the thickness of plate, grain size, and aspect ratio of oxide and sulfide inclusions after hot-rolling are provided quantitatively. This work aims to contribute to the inclusion engineering concept in the manufacturing of new generation AHSS.

Increasing population pressures, escalating consumption patterns and rapid industrial development are key contributors to this degradation. There is a growing recognition that sustainable development policies, plans and actions have a better chance of being implemented when they are supported by an educated, informed public. The objective of this paper is to highlight the need for the inclusion of environmental education into the curricula of engineering studies in order to raise environmental awareness at an early stage in their careers. The main aim of such environmental education is to provide engineers with the background to environmental issues such that they develop solutions that take into account the needs of the natural environment and which seek to minimise any negative impact.

In consequence, chemical dissolution of the tool into the chip occurs by a diffusion mechanism, causing chemical wear. Oxley incorporated the concept of seizure in his quantitative model for flow chip morphology. Oxley introduced the concept of equilibrium shear angle in his quantitative model for flow chip morphology, which incorporates the work of shear in the secondary shear zone instead of friction, once atomic contact is established, but Oxley s model ignored potential interaction from metallurgical softening events in the secondary shear zone, which led to prediction of unrealistically high temperature at high cutting speeds. In fact, metallurgical softening events do occur particularly at high cutting speeds, causing shear localisation, which leads to significant deviation from Oxley s model predictions. In this paper, Oxley s model will be extended to capture the interaction of shear localisation in the secondary shear zone on the mechanics of metal cutting. Dynamic recrystallisation, phase transformation of the matrix and geometric softening owing to second phase particles are identified as important microstructural softening events causing shear localisation, which could intervene before the equilibrium shear angle is reached. The occurrence of shear localisation is shown to alter the mechanics of metal cutting, chip morphology and the tool wear mechanism. A phenomenological database in model alloys will be presented to validate the model assumptions. The application of the model in the design of self-lubricating free cutting steel for moderate and high cutting speeds will be examined.Keywords: METAL CUTTINGFERROUS ALLOYSCHIP FORMATIONSOFTENINGTOOL WEAR Authors: S.

Yet there is growing evidence that more diverse organizations are more successful and effective. There is also a global shortage of STEM and engineering skills that can be tackled by addressing the lack of diversity in the field. One obvious way to view this problem is by looking at gender. Women make up 50% of the population, but in Engineering the number of female students and professionals is clearly less than this, often around 10 25% in many parts of the world. This underrepresentation of women leads us to think about other groups that are underrepresented in Engineering; these include Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) and those from socially deprived backgrounds. This paper examines a number of approaches to support diversity and inclusion to encourage a greater uptake of engineering by underrepresented groups and to retain people in the sector.

Homochiral stacks of PHTP molecules surround polar chains of hydrogen-bonded NPP molecules in a channel-type, honeycomb architecture. The NPP chains are arranged in an all-parallel (rather than an antiparallel) fashion. Crystals of PHTP 5 NPP show second harmonic generation for incident light of wavelength 1064 nm, an electro-optical and a pyroelectric effect. The X-ray diffraction pattern exhibits Bragg-like reflections, interspersed with planes of diffuse scattering and weak satellite reflections superimposed on these planes, features which are indicative of extensive disorder. In spite of this, an orthorhombic average structure model could be deduced from the Bragg-like reflections (space group Cmc21, a 15.023(2), b 23.198(2), and c 4.730(1) (T 100 K), wR2 0.088, goodness of fit 1.38). A qualitative interpretation of diffuse and satelite scattering is given. Crystals of PHTP 5 NPP are approximately hexagonal prisms. If the tailor-made additive 1-(p-tolyl)piperazine (TP) is present during crystallization, the habit changes to approximately hexagonal plates and TP is incorporated in small amounts. Crystals of the composition PHTP 5 NPP 0.93 TP 0.07 lose the ability of second harmonic generation. The observation of polar properties for a crystal structure whose polar building blocks, the -NO2 HN- hydrogen-bonded NPP chains, are 14 15 apart and separated by PHTP hydrocarbon molecules is surprising, but can be explained in terms of a Markov chain model of crystal growth. The same simple model accounts for the loss of polarity in the presence of the tailor-made additive TP. The knowledge gained during the present analysis provides a rational tool for the engineering of polar properties of PHTP and similar channel-type inclusion compounds.

This harmful effect has been widely recognized, but available solutions are limited. Here, to prevent such oxidation-induced Cr-depletion in corrosion-resistant alloys, we proposed a general strategy based on inclusion engineering using oxygen-preferred elements in alloy design. The inclusion-Cr depletion-passivation relationship was systematically studied in 3.5 wt% NaCl using commercially cast original, Si-modified, Al-modified, and Ti-modified CoCrFeMnNi alloys, in which the prominent inclusions were identified as MnCr2O4, MnO-SiO2, AlN, and TiN, respectively. Unlike the original alloy, all modified alloys prevented Cr-depletion with improved corrosion resistance; however, the Si-modified alloy exhibited the most remarkable improvement due to few nitride by-products. Thermodynamic analysis on the free energy changes of potential reactions revealed that all the additives were preferential to be oxidized over Cr, whereas Al and Ti nitridation reactions have the most negative free energies compared to all oxidation reactions, which validated experimental results. From experiments and thermodynamics, an effective method was proposed, and its application was discussed with three newly-designed alloys prepared using arc melting. We believe the proposed strategy can be widely used in designing alloys to prevent oxidation-induced Cr-depletion.

Modification of the inclusion type, aiming for deformable non-metallic inclusions, which are less hazardous for machining and fatigue behaviour of engineering steels, has been the focus of the research work. This leads to the use of a Si killed route and control of the secondary steelmaking process to place the inclusion composition on the zone of the low melting point of the quaternary thermodynamical equilibrium MgO-CaO-SiO2-Al2O3. To verify the suitability of the process modifications (acid slags, low basicity, reduction of Al and Ti contents to be as low as possible) wire rod cleanness analysis and fatigue tests were performed on a typical spring steel grade. Fatigue test results were promising, finding no inclusion as a cause of failure in several tested heats, which fulfils the usual cleanness and fatigue requirements. As a consequence, some general rules are provided to allow steelmakers to manufacture high quality engineering steels, guaranteeing high fatigue life and performance to the automotive industry. More improvements still should be developed to obtain a more competitive and reliable product. Authors: Caroline Bertrand, Joseba Molinero, S.

Inclusion bodies have been widely described as spherical or pseudo-spherical particles with only minor morphological variability, mostly restricted to their size. Here we have identified a cellular gene in Escherichia coli (clpP) that controls the in vivo fabrication process of inclusion bodies. In the absence of the encoded protease, the dynamics of protein deposition is perturbed, resulting in unusual tear-shaped particles with enhanced surface-volume ratios. This fact modifies the ability of inclusion bodies to promote mammalian cell attachment and differentiation upon surface decoration.

The IDEAS project brought together experts in maker education, autism inclusion, engineering, co-design, and research. Over 2 years, this group adapted and pilot tested a museum-based maker program so that it could be run as an informal club in autism-inclusion middle schools (students ages 10 14) in New York City. in the United States. In the third year, teachers in each school implemented the redesigned program on their own. Researchers conducted a mixed-methods study of the impact of the program on participants. The study used observations and interviews; social interaction analysis, a pre/post survey of science, technology, and engineering self-efficacy and career interest; and a pre/post assessment of understanding of the engineering design process (EDP). Autistic and neurotypical students were in either the treatment condition (if they joined the maker program) or a business-as-usual comparison condition (if they did not join the club). Our analyses of the survey and EDP assessment compared the maker group with the comparison group and showed that participating in the maker program led to improved outcomes in the following constructs: technology and engineering self-efficacy (effect size 0.80), technology and engineering interest (effect size 1.73), vicarious experience (effect size 0.57), science appreciation (effect size 0.21), and understanding of the engineering design process (effect size 0.44). The maker program benefited neurotypical students more than autistic students on technology and engineering interest and science appreciation, possibly because autistic students started with a high level of STEM interest. Qualitative analysis demonstrated that all students engaged in the EDP and pursued a wide range of interests, that autistic students who struggled in normal school settings were successful in creating their projects and communicating with peers about those projects, and that teachers reported being better able to see what their autistic students were capable of accomplishing when they were freed from the constraints of typical classroom instruction.

We suggest that there is a need also to work for a higher share of women faculty to obtain more sustainable recruitment and retainment of women in ICT. Moreover, we found that the probability of dropout among men students was systematically reduced with increased gender balance, which indicates that more gender-balanced programs are more attractive to remain in for both men and women.

Diversity and Inclusion (D amp;I) are contextualized topics that shift objectives from country to country. The role of D amp;I in engineering education and practice has gained prominence in recent years due to the fact that engineers are facing increased need for global collaborations and are expected to be able to work in highly diverse teams and within different cultures. D amp;I initiatives in the field of engineering generally include gender, ethnicity, and national origin, and may include persons who are economically underprivileged and persons with disabilities. While the prominence of D amp;I has increased, international learning outcomes and collaborations within these efforts are limited. Within a global community a common platform would allow for the sharing of best practices and maximize learning opportunities and impact. By examining models from around the world, we can begin to consolidate, optimize, and disseminate the global benefits of D amp;I. In this work, various programs are reviewed as success cases because they have increased the numbers of underrepresented students who enroll in and graduate from STEM programs. The potential for solidarity amongst Diversity amp; Inclusion initiatives and programs in different regions of the world is explored. Efforts are made to determine what can be learned from synergies across D amp;I activities.

In this work, the current understanding of the origin and classification of NMIs is reviewed, highlighting the dramatic development of the last decades. This includes the discussion of the thermodynamics of inclusion formation and the current knowledge on the effects of melt shop processing variable on NMIs composition, amount and size distribution. The development of inclusion engineering tailoring the process to obtain the desired NMIs is highlighted and the development in selected areas tire cord, springs and bearing steels as well as prevention of nozzle clogging is used to illustrate this development. The promising field of oxide metallurgy is also discussed in the context of inclusion engineering. Finally, the difficulties in meaningfully characterizing and quantifying NMIs are briefly commented. In summary it is concluded that inclusion control in steels has evolved significantly in the last decades. This is due to the progress in understanding the interplay between thermodynamics, steel and slag chemical composition as well as melt shop processing. This made possible the tailoring of non-metallic inclusions via processing, to optimize steel properties. Nonetheless, some important problems remain and must still be solved to improve inclusion control and optimization.

Women consist of just approximately 20% of our engineering undergraduate programs nationally, and roughly 14% of our national professional workforce. Absent from these numbers and research into gender minority experiences are students who lay further on the margins of discussion, awareness, inclusion, and acknowledgement of existence - students who identify as nonbinary or other genders aside from man or woman. This paper presents background literature on gender, gender minority experiences in higher education, nonbinary gender identity, and aims to present points of discussion to facilitate further engagement with a more nuanced understanding of gender in engineering. Gender as a social system is defined by multiplicity and fluidity and does not fit within two unitary and discrete categories. The majority of current gender in engineering scholarship utilizes a conceptualization of gender which does not acknowledge or incorporate more than two gender options, and is rooted in increasingly rejected notions of biological essentialism. Nonbinary and gender nonconforming students, some of which also identify within the transgender population, exist in liminal spaces throughout society and higher education, and continuation of this scholarship tacitly denies their existence by framing gender as intrinsically linked to two biological categories. Engineering professionals, faculty, and students who identify as neither men nor women must be included and our conversation be expanded for academically rigorous investigation into gender dynamics and create inclusive engineering spaces. Conversations around gender neutral bathrooms are just the beginnings of widespread cultural change to support gender expansive engineers. The discipline must re-think our approaches towards gender equity in engineering and the theoretical conceptualization of gender to not only frame its inequity through the sharp underrepresentation of women, but its gender dynamics as experienced by nonbinary and gender nonconforming students. We must continue to make space for marginalized gender identities and gendered experiences. Through reviewing existing literature and integrating my own intimate experiences I seek to discuss preliminary efforts towards nonbinary inclusion in our teaching, professionalization, and language. This paper represents a point of entry for discussing nonbinary inclusion as part of the discipline s continued commitment to cultural change surrounding gender.

Although this research is only beginning to document the contours of these issues, it suggests that successful social change in engineering requires that equality and inclusion be advanced through multiple fronts in engineering education, including the policies and perspectives of engineering administrators and leaders. In this paper, we draw on survey data (currently being collected) from over 40 deans and Program Directors of U.S. Engineering and Engineering Technology colleges and programs to understand their views on LGBTQ-inclusive practices and policies. In particular, our paper describes (1) deans assessment of the climate in their college for LGBTQ students and faculty, (2) deans personal support for LGBTQ equality and inclusion measures (e.g. faculty-wide Safe Zone training, hiring initiatives, inclusion of LGBTQ status in non-discrimination statements in job advertisements) and (3) deans perception of support among their faculty and students for LGBTQ inclusion measures. These findings provide important insights into the cultural and policy landscapes in engineering education for LGBTQ individuals and the (un)supportiveness of this key group of stakeholders of the promotion of LGBTQ equality.

This study explored Ce3 -doped Tb3Al5 xScxO12 crystals (where x ranges from 0.5 to 3.0), revealing a novel approach to control luminescence and photoconversion through atomic size mismatch engineering. Raman spectroscopy confirmed the coexistence of garnet and perovskite phases, with Sc substitution significantly influencing the garnet lattice and induced A1g mode softening up to Sc concentration x 2.0. The Sc atoms controlled sub-eutectic inclusion formation, creating efficient light scattering centers and unveiling a compositional threshold for octahedral site saturation. This modulation enabled the control of energy transfer dynamics between Ce3 and Tb3 ions, enhancing luminescence and mitigating quenching. The Sc admixing process regulated luminous efficacy (LE), color rendering index (CRI), and correlated color temperature (CCT), with adjustments in CRI from 68 to 84 and CCT from 3545 K to 12,958 K. The Ce3 -doped Tb3Al5 xScxO12 crystal (where x 2.0) achieved the highest LE of 114.6 lm/W and emitted light at a CCT of 4942 K, similar to daylight white.

All of the racemic dibromides 2 4 and 6 form clathrate compounds where their opposite enantiomers are joined edge edge by means of C H N dimers. Hence this interaction is robust and of considerable value in crystal engineering. Modification of the benchmark centrosymmetric aryl H N dimer can result, however, in more complex modifications which better suit a given host guest combination. Therefore a range of different C H N dimers is observed, with the new motif present in (6) (benzene)1.5 completing a sub-set of these variants.

Engineering educators have been studying ways to make teams more effective and inclusive. However, students interpersonal interactions often create exclusionary experiences. Purpose/Hypothesis: This study investigates how the team formation process and what kinds of teaming practices and behaviors promote inclusive team environments. We were sensitized to Tuckman and Jensen s (1977) revised theory of the five stages of teaming along with opportunity structures theory as frameworks to study how particular team interactions did or did not promote the inclusion of its members. Design/Method: This interpretive multi-case study used team observations, classroom artifacts, and student interviews in a first-year engineering course to understand the experiences of three teams. The primary data source, student interviews, were analyzed to understand the individual and collective team experience. These results were triangulated with the other data sources to build three team descriptions and a cross-team comparison. Results: Our findings indicate that the process of storming and norming in teams is an essential point in which social inclusion is built into teaming practices or not. While all teams, regardless of inclusive behaviors, were academically successful, the inclusive norms developed by some teams increased student learning and belonging. Conclusions: The emphasis on teaming in engineering education has often focused on the effectiveness of teams for a final project. However, the process of teaming and how peers shape the engineering environment is just as important for student s belonging and persistence. The results of this work can provide strategies for supporting students teaming processes to develop more inclusive teams.

Calcium treatment somehow modified the inclusions, however, many large inclusions were generated, and the modification effect would be dramatically decreased by the formation of large amount of CaS inclusions, which appeared with three main distribution forms.

Transformation of solid alumina clusters to liquid calcium aluminates by calcium is a much used technique to avoid nozzle blocking in continuous casting of aluminium deoxidised steels. Calcium treatment is also a key method to improve machinability, which can be further improved by increased sulphur content. Resulphurised steels, however, tend to have casting problems due to deficient modification of oxides or formation of solid CaS inclusions which also have a tendency to clog the nozzle. In this study, the formation and transformation of liquid and solid inclusions containing oxidic and sulphidic components were examined by thermodynamic calculations. A quasichemical slag model was applied to calculate equilibrium oxide and sulphide inclusions in steel. Calculations were carried out over a wide temperature range to study the formation of species in the melt corresponding to ladle treatment conditions as well as casting. To examine inclusion behaviour during casting and solidification, the interdendritic solidification model, IDS, was coupled with thermodynamic equilibrium calculations. The results show the conditions in which liquid inclusions can be formed with calcium treatment. The calculations were performed at different temperatures and varying calcium, aluminium and sulphur contents. The effect of total oxygen content was also studied. The main components in liquid calcium aluminates were CaO and Al2O3 plus some SiO2 and CaS. The stability relations of different compounds alter as a function of temperature. An abrupt change occurs during solidification when the partition of the inclusion forming elements between the liquid and solid iron phases are taken into account.

In addition, melting point of the inclusions in low aluminum steel is lower, the cleanliness of the steel is relatively improved because of the inclusions floating up, and the deformation aspect ratio of calcium aluminate inclusions with a certain amount of Ti2O3 is effectively improved, which is about 1 2 while the composition of oxide core is xAl2O3 35 55%, xTi2O3 15 35%, and xCaO 10 25%. As a result, less calcium is needed to modify the alumina inclusions to liquid calcium aluminate in the case of lower aluminum deoxidized steel, thus the calcium treatment effect can be improved. The low aluminum in steel is more effective to control the inclusion characteristics to reduce the harm of MnS and to improve the cleanliness of steel.

With calcium consumption of 0.23 kg/t, inconsistent calcium in steel, SEN clogging and slide gate erosions were reported. Nozzle clogging during casting of LCAK steels was primarily caused by deposition of complex oxide and sulfide inclusions and slide gate erosion by excess calcium in steel. Optimum calcium in steel was essential to achieve desired inclusion composition conducive to smooth casting and eliminate slide gate or SEN erosion effectively. With calcium consumption of 0.12kg/ton optimum calcium content in steel could be achieved through i) improved steel cleanliness, ii) restricted CaS formation and iii) optimum aluminium content in steel. Process optimisation resulted in reduction in aluminium consumption by 1.0 kg/t and improvement in steel cleanliness with consistent total oxygen level of ≤ 42 ppm.

The degree of shape control is increased with the increase of stirring energy supplied and the decrease of the time from aluminum addition to calcium addition.

Samples of steel secondary treatment ( Ladle ) and continuous casting billets ( Tundish ) were obtained from an electric steel mill. Entry data for this study were obtained in heats carried out in the steel plant. Furthermore, analyses were performed with a Scanning Electron Microscope ( SEM ) and an Energy Dispersive Spectrometer ( EDS ), as well as chemical analysis of both steel and total oxygen. In the Ladle sample, after calcium addition, inclusions had concentrations between 30 and 45% CaO and consisted mainly of calcium aluminates with MgO content of 10%. In the Tundish sample, inclusions contained a high percentage of alumina. Combining the characterization of inclusions with a computational thermodynamics model, the obtained results showed that the ideal range of calcium may vary between 10 and 14 ppm to form liquid inclusions with a minimum CaS content for the O, S and Al levels from SAE 8620 in this process stage. An analysis of Mg influence on the formation of calcium aluminates was also carried out. For contents of Mg found in aluminium killed steels treated with Ca, Mg does not significantly influence the formation of calcium aluminates inclusions. Higher calcium contents can be taken into account, depending on both the process type in steel production and the demanded product properties. The present study shows that the combined application of both inclusions characterization techniques and computational thermodynamics can drastically reduce the empiricism regarding the development of processes for the control of non metallic inclusions in steels. Thus, this research can contribute to increase the efficiency of manufacturing processes, improve the quality of existent products and make possible the economic development of new ones.

The total oxygen (T.O.) content increased from 10 to 24 ppm just after the reoxidation occurred, while it finally decreased to 14 ppm since inclusions were floated to the top of the steel and absorbed by the formed slag layer. The increased T.O. favored the decomposition of CaS, especially for the heat with high sulfur contents. The vaporization of calcium, which leads to the decrease of calcium content, is the driving force for the evolution of inclusions from CaO-CaS-(Al 2 O 3 ) to CaO-Al 2 O 3 -(CaS) due to the limited degree of reoxidation. The contact angle between inclusions and the molten steel increased with the increase of Al 2 O 3 in calcium alumina, which favored the removal of inclusions. Increased sulfur content decreased the surface tension of molten steel, which led to remove less inclusions since the contact angle between inclusions and the molten steel was decreased.

The kinetics of the modification of Al2O3 inclusions by calcium treatment were studied in high-carbon hard wire steel based on the unreacted shrinking core model, considering the transfer of Ca and Al through the boundary layer and within the product layer, coupled with thermodynamic equilibrium at the interfaces. The diffusion of Al in the inclusion layer was the limiting link in the inclusion modification process. The Ca concentration in molten steel had the greatest influence on the inclusion modification time. The modification time for inclusions tended to be longer in the transformation of higher CaO-containing calcium aluminate. The modification of Al2O3 into CA6 was fastest, while the most time was needed to modify CA into C12A7. It took about six times time longer at the later stage of inclusion modification than at the early stage. The complete modification time for inclusions increased with the square of their radii.

Both conventional and calcium treated quality of the 3 plate steel grades are investigated. The inclusion types in the conventional quality of these aluminum-killed steels were found to be Type II manganese sulfides and alumina inclusion galaxies. Calcium treatment has been observed to prevent the formation of both of these detrimental inclusion types. The through-thickness tensile percent reduction area in all 3 plate steels was significantly improved by calcium treatment. The upper shelf Charpy-V-notch, dynamic tear and J-Integral fracture toughness were substantially improved in all testing orientations for all 3 steels by calcium treatment. Although the fatigue endurance limit and fatigue crack propagation properties were only slightly enhanced in A5l6-70 by calcium treatment, the fatigue crack propagation properties were significantly improved in A633C and A5l4F. INTRODUCTION Offshore structures and in particular offshore oil drilling platforms have to perform under severely stressed situations and in very harsh environments. For these reasons many of the steels used in platform construction have been newly developed or improved to meet this more stringent service application. ne improvement has been the development of steels with low sulfur levels and inclusion shape control through using Calcium Treatment, Lukens Fineline R. These steels resist lamellar tearing on welding during fabrication and also have enhanced toughness and fatigue properties to improve service performance. Calcium Treatment (CaT) quality plate steels have already been applied in various offshore structures, for example in node areas where lamellar tearing is a concern. Also CaT steels have been employed in cases where low temperature toughness is required or in deep water applications where high reliability is demanded. Steels produced by CaT have significantly lower levels of indigenous nonmetallic inclusions than steels produced using Conventional (CON) techniques. These inclusions precipitate as discrete phases during the solidification of molten steel, i.e. sulfides and oxides. A review of the CaT process in comparison to CON techniques, as well as the kinds of inclusions found will be given in this paper. CaT has been found to improve levels of tensile ductility, particularly in the through-thickness testing orientation, impact and fracture toughness and fatigue properties in a number of aluminum killed steels (1-6). In many instances the properties have approached, although not equalled, the quality of electroslag remelted (ESR) steels, which have previously been shown to supply a superior level of properties in plate steels. The steels used in offshore structures can have a wide range of strength levels. For this reason the properties of 3 different plate steel grades will be reported here namely, A5l6-70, A633C and A5l4F. These steels have minimum 0.2% offset yield strength minimums of 38 ksi (263 MPa), 50 ksi (345 MPa) and 100 ksi (690 MPa), respectively. Both CaT and CON quality steels in each grade will be examined. But first a review of the steelmaking practices involved and the nonmetallic inclusions found in these steels will be presented.

The use of titanium to obtain FSS sheets that are resistant to ridging due to the formation of equiaxed rather than columnar grains during solidification is well established. However, the use of titanium results in clogging the submerged entry nozzle during casting, causing surface defects in cold rolled products and overall production losses. To overcome the clogging problem, calcium treatment is conducted in the ladle furnace to transform inclusions into the liquid state. However, this delays the formation of the TiN inclusions which act as nuclei for the equiaxed grains, thereby increasing the fraction of columnar grains in the slabs and susceptibility to ridging in the final cold rolled and annealed product. Herein, the effect of calcium treatment and electromagnetic stirring (EMS) on the equiaxed grain ratio and ridging is studied with industrially produced material. The beneficial effect of EMS on grain structure and ridging is largely lost at high calcium contents, but it can be retained, provided the level of calcium is maintained at a sufficiently low, optimum level.

Nozzle clogging eventually leads to a disruption of normal casting operations. This happens when solid alumina inclusions get accumulate in the nozzle of submerged entry nozzle (SEN). Therefore, it is required to understand the inclusion characteristics (shape, size and chemistry), which forms during the steelmaking process. Calcium is added in the steel ladle furnace (LF) in the form of CaSi wire to modify inclusions and to desulphurize steel. The range in which all the oxides become liquid and no solid sulphides begin to form is regarded as the optimum window or liquid inclusion window for calcium treatment. It is a target to obtain this calcium addition window, during calcium addition in the ladle furnace. This window mainly depends on the sulfur and total oxygen contents of the liquid steel bath. In the present study, inclusions characteristics such as volume fraction of inclusions, inclusion rating and EDS analysis of inclusions has been carried out using SEM-EDS. Thermodynamic study is carried out using thermodynamic software FACTSAGE and databases to find out formation of various calcium aluminates and the precipitation of CaS. Results show that liquid inclusion window mainly depends mainly on the sulphur level, total oxygen and aluminum content in the steel. These windows will help in calculation of calcium addition range for optimizing the addition of calcium in the ladle. These nomograms have been validated with actual plant condition to reduce the nozzle clogging during continuous casting.

The results show that the inclusions in molten steel before calcium treatment are mainly Al2O3 inclusions. The inclusions in molten steel are CaO Al2O3 after calcium treatment with a holding time of 10 min, while the inclusions are mainly 3CaO Al2O3 with a holding time of 30 min. And 12CaO 7Al2O3 inclusions are observed in molten steel when T.O content increases to 40 ppm after calcium treatment with a holding time of 30 min. As the increase of T.O content from 10 ppm to 40 ppm, the difference between the upper and lower limits of the critical calcium content corresponding to the liquid zone increases from 5 ppm to 17 ppm. The increase of T.O content in molten steel will enlarge the liquid zone range of inclusion modification by calcium treatment, and increase the critical calcium content. With the increase of magnesium content in molten steel, the liquid phase ratio of inclusions modification by calcium treatment decreases. To obtain the liquid phase ratio of inclusions at least 50% in molten steel, not only the calcium content in steel should be strictly controlled, but also the magnesium content in steel should not be larger than 15 ppm. With the increase of sulfur content in molten steel, the liquid zone range of inclusion modification by calcium treatment becomes narrow.

The effects of inclusion composition, morphology, quantity, and size in H08A welding rod steel before and after calcium treatment were studied by metallographic microscope, scanning electron microscope (SEM), and energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS). Thermodynamic studies show that the addition of calcium can form various forms of xCaO yAl2O3, under the condition that the composition of molten steel remains unchanged, the control of calcium content is the key to generate low melting point calcium-aluminate complex non-metallic inclusions and improve the quality of molten steel. The production practice in steel plant shows that for welding rod steels, the calcium content in a suitable range can meet the requirements of calcium treatment. Effective calcium treatment can not only transform the high melting point Al2O3 inclusions into the low melting point complex non-metallic inclusions between 3CaO Al2O3 and 12CaO 7Al2O3, but also make the original shape-diversified inclusions into the spherical calcium-aluminate complex non-metallic inclusions. Meanwhile, the total number of inclusions and large-scale inclusions in welding rod steel are reduced, and the inclusions tend to disperse in the steel, which is very conducive to the improvement of steel quality. The results show that the modification path of magnesium aluminate spinel in steel is as follows: Al2O3 → MgO-Al2O3 → MgO-CaO-Al2O3. In addition, calcium treatment can modify MgO-Al2O3 spinel in steel into liquid MgO-CaO-Al2O3 complex non-metallic inclusions with low melting point.

In this presentation, the main features of mixing liquid steel by gas stirring are discussed. The criteria for bubbling and jetting during gas injection are considered including interaction of powder load on flow regimes. It is of interest to know the domains of bubbling and jetting behaviour in order to minimize the effect of back attack which is responsible for additional wear of bottom linings and tuyere pipes. Quantitative information is given on velocity, the radius and the pumping capacity of the buoyant plume. The relations lead to the conclusion that the gas flow should be apportioned to two or more plugs in order to increase the efficiency of the pumping effect. Furthermore, the macroscopic flow pattern is substantially influenced by the ratio of height to diameter of the ladle. Especially at high ratios dead volumes near the ladle bottom are observed. Further examples for the influence of fluid flow on reactions, dispersing and separating in the ladle and tundish are given. At first approach, mixing time depends on the gas flow rate or on the specific power input. But the details are much more complicated. It is shown that the mixing process can be described by two types of models among others: the turbulent recirculation model and the model of partial volumes. The comparison of calculated concentration time dependencies with plant results confirms the practicability and usefulness of the model of partial volumes. It is also concluded that the water model results for ladles may be transferred to plant conditions. In total all examples that are discussed emphasize the great significance of model simulations and model calculations as instruments for process improvement and process development.

An improvement of the process control supported by knowledge of the thermodynamics and kinetics of the desulphurisation reaction is of great importance, especially for the production of steels with very low sulphur contents. To investigate the removal of sulphur, operational trials were carried out in 185 t steel ladles. In the trials the stirring gas flow rate, the pressure on the bath surface and the steel composition were varied as process parameters. The obtained results show that ladle slags saturated with lime have a high sulphide capacity. The desulphurisation rate of steel melts increases if the specific stirring energy is enhanced by increasing the gas flow rate or reducing the pressure on the bath surface.

The compositions of the oxide melts were chosen to correspond to those of ladle slags in secondary metallurgy and to casting powders in continuous casting of steel. The first model uses Butler s equation to calculate the surface tensions of the multicomponent melts and is based on Tanaka et al. s consideration of the ionic radii of the components as well as surface tensions and molar volumes of pure components. In the second model the same ionic radii dependent contribution is applied as activity coefficients to a constrained free energy model where the surface layer is considered as a separate phase in the system. In the model, the constrained interfacial area is analogous with a component mass balance in a traditional computation of a multiphase chemical equilibrium and surface energy with the corresponding chemical potential. Based on the results it is concluded that the effect of temperature on the surface tensions of the considered oxide melts is insignificant when compared to the effect of chemical composition. According to the validation the results agree well with published surface tension data.

However, there are no industrially consolidated techniques that allow in-situ analysis of the slag chemical composition, as in the case of steel with OES-spectrometers. In this work, a method to analyze spectral reflectance of ladle furnace slag samples to estimate their composition is proposed. This method does not require sample preprocessing and is based on a regression algorithm that mathematically maps the spectral reflectance of the slag with its actual composition with errors lower than 10%. Specifically designed normalization and calibration steps have been proposed to allow a global model training with data from different locations. This allows real-time monitoring of the thermodynamical state of the steel process by feeding a thermodynamic equilibrium optimization model. The system has been validated on several ArcelorMittal locations achieving process savings of 0.71 Euro per liquid steel tons.

The after-corrosion refractory was investigated in view of changes in its microstructure and phase composition by SEM/EDS and XRD techniques, respectively. At 1350 °C slags slightly infiltrated the microstructure, whereas at 1450 °C slags infiltrated the alumina-spinel refractory causing its significant corrosion. As a result of corrosion, new phases were formed, including calcium dialuminate (Ca2Al4O7), calcium hexaluminate (CaAl12O19), and gehlenite (Ca2AlSi2O7). Formation of calcium aluminate layers in the microstructure of the refractory inhibited further dissolution of alumina aggregates; however, expansive behavior of CaAl12O19 raised the microstructure porosity. The additional SiO2 in the slag doubled the amount of low melting gehlenite in the matrix, accelerating the corrosion process of alumina-spinel brick at high temperatures.

This study selected typical secondary copper, aluminum, zinc, and lead plants to investigate the emissions of PCNs in secondary nonferrous production in China. The toxic equivalency (TEQ) emission factor for PCNs released to the environment is highest for secondary copper production, at 428.4 ng TEQ t(-1), followed by secondary aluminum, zinc, and lead production, at 142.8, 125.7, and 20.1 ng TEQ t(-1), respectively.

Several attempts to recover such slag as lime replacement, slag flux, pozzolanic materials have been made for long time with pros and cons. However, the amount of recyclable slag is limited and often their employment requires higher energy demand than traditional materials. Nevertheless, the use of SMS in agriculture is poorly or never considered. In this article, the legal and technical evaluation of SMS as raw material for fertilizers production is investigated. Compliance of technical specification, toxic metals concentration, and leaching behavior allows to confirm the technical feasibility of SMS use as a raw material for fertilizers manufacture. Both from the literature data and the experimental results on 16 industrial SMS samples, the requirements for calcium magnesium sulfur based fertilizers, soil correctives and for sanitizing agricultural sewage sludge, appear fully satisfied. The CaO concentration in SMS (35 60 wt%) is abundantly higher than the requirements (≥15 wt%) and CaO is present in most part as water soluble complexes such as calcium aluminates (70 wt%), silicates (10 wt%), and sulfide (4 wt%). The pH of the SMS samples leachate is comparable to that of fresh lime (12.35 vs 12.46), highlighting a better behavior for sewage sludge sanitation with respect to limestone (9.98). The measured toxic metals and leachate elements concentration over the corresponding admittable threshold are always lower than 0.5 and 1.0 (mg kg 1 /mg kg 1 ) for liming materials. Finally, these results lead to officially approve the use of SMS as soil corrective according to the Italian Fertilizer Regulation.

Data handling is a challenge, especially considering correlations of process control data with indicators such as actual steel homogeneity and cleanliness after casting. Here in this study, approaches to improving sensor data quality and maximizing the utilization of the abundance of data obtained during the RH process are presented. Time series data from process control measurements like off gas composition or chamber pressure, even though highly connected to specific domain knowledge, can be tackled with machine learning methods, such as recognition of characteristic curve sections or categorization of curves with clustering algorithms. Visual surveillance offers the possibility of image analyses of the surface flow observation inside the vacuum chamber with different approaches such as image classification or feature detection algorithms.

There are 4. the forming factor, the distribution emissions factor and the concentration shrinkage factors. Fundamental differences of calculation methods of primary and secondary gas emissions were shown. There was also defined that the formation of secondary emission occurs in the volume of air space in which the concentration of primary emission exceeds 5. its background concentration in the atmosphere. The analysis of the secondary emissions concentration as a function of the distance from OJSC Magnitogorsk Iron and Steel Works was built with the help of the spatially distributed source method. Graphs of the H 2 SO 4 concentration depending on the distance from the source of the primary emission were built at different wind speeds. It has been found that the function of the concentration dependence on distance has a distinct maximum which value can be determined for any wind speed, knowing the average power of the primary emissions for a specific time period.

Secondary refining techniques, including gas blowing, slag treatment, plasma refining, solvent refining and other refining silicon techniques were summarized. The effects of gas species and slag systems on boron removal efficiency were emphatically discussed. Experimental and theoretical investigations show that a united technique of combining water vapor and oxygen gases blowing with slag treatment containing chloride or fluoride has achieved an amazing improvement for boron removal from molten silicon. Plasma refining and solvent refining also display high efficiency but acid leaching treatments, vacuum volatilization, electron beam and directional solidifications are hardly effective to boron removal. As for the potential industrial application of this united technique, the authors propose that some experimental and theoretical studies in dynamics should be further explored.

A number of metallurgical factors are known to influence phenomena of secondary recrystallization, such as the occurrence of secondary recrystallization and texture of secondary recrystallized grains. Typically, inhibitors existing in silicon steel, of which the amount and morphology are changed by addition of a small amount of elements, slag reheating conditions etc., affect the size and texture of primary and secondary recrystallized grains. It has also been recognized that a preferred orientation in secondary recrystallzation may be correlated with the texture of primary recrystallized grains, which is formed by cold rolling and subsequent annealing. These phenomena occurring in secondary recrystallization have been systematically studied by changing process conditions, while in the meantime a few techniques for controlling secondary recrystallization have been developed. From the viewpoint of microstructure and texture controls of polycrystalline materials, an overview of these metallurgical factors influencing secondary recrystallization and the correlation between these factors is given.

The different types of reinforcement being used, together with the alternative processing methods, are discussed. Depending on the initial processing method, different factors have to be taken into consideration to produce a high quality billet. With powder metallurgy processing, the composition of the matrix and the type of reinforcement are independent of one another. However, in molten metal processing they are intimately linked in terms of the different reactivities which occur between reinforcement and matrix in the molten state. The factors controlling the distribution of reinforcement are also dependent on the initial processing method. Secondary fabrication methods, such as extrusion and rolling, are essential in processing composites produced by powder metallurgy, since they are required to consolidate the composite fully. Other methods, such as spray casting, molten metal infiltration, and molten metal mixing give an essentially fully consolidated product directly, but extrusion, etc., can improve the properties by modifying the reinforcement distribution. The mechanical properties obtained in metal matrix composites are dependent on a wide range of factors, and the present understanding, and areas requiring further study, are discussed. The successful commercial production of metal matrix composites will finally depend on their cost effectiveness for different applications. This requires optimum methods of processing, machining, and recycling, and the routes being developed to achieve this are considered. Authors: D. J.

The aim of this study is to gain knowledge about the behavior of non-metallic inclusions at the interface between a growing solid front and a liquid phase. The focus is on the effect of the titanium and titanium oxide content on the inclusions and the different phenomena, which occurs at the solid/liquid interface. This was studied in samples of low-carbon steels de-oxidized by different combinations of Al, Ca, and Ti. For this purpose, each metal sample of 0.19 g was melted at a temperature close to 1550 A degrees C in an argon atmosphere and solidified under different solidification rates. A direct observation of inclusion behavior during solidification was made using a confocal scanning laser microscope equipped with an infrared gold image furnace. The alloying elements in the sample varied between: C 0.002-0.044; Si 0.02-1.33; Mn 0.12-1.33; P 0.003-0.016; S 0.003-0.01; Al 0.002-0,033; Ni 0-0.28; Cr 0-0.25; Ti 0.008-0.065; Ca 0.0007-0.002; O 0.002-0.0114 and N 0.0028-0.0056 (mass%). Several types of inclusions with different morphologies were found within the sample. The morphology of the observed inclusions on the molten steel surface varied from round alumina and calcium-oxide-rich inclusion to needle-shaped titanium oxide-rich inclusions. The observed motions of the inclusions at the vicinity of the front of the solidifying steels were classified. At a low solidifying velocity and a small inclusion size, inclusions flowed away from the solidifying front. Furthermore, they also or got pushed a distance and thereafter flowed away from the interface. At a medium velocity and a slightly bigger size, inclusions tend to get pushed in front of the solidifying front. Another observation was that at a high velocity and a large particle size, inclusions tend to get engulfed or pushed and then engulfed by the progressing front. The relationship among the morphology, chemical composition of inclusions and the solidifying velocity is discussed in this article. Authors: Kristofer J.

The work includes thermodynamic calculations of the slag-metal equilibrium, CFD modelling of slag-metal reactions, and plant trials. Results from the various studies are presented and discussed in this paper. Models for predicting slag properties (sulphide capacity, viscosity, and oxide activities) in liquid slags as functions of slag composition and temperature have been used for the calculation of data which have been employed in static and dynamic modelling of sulphur refining. The results from static modelling show that the method allows fast and easy evaluation of the theoretical desulphurisation conditions during degassing at Ovako Steel AB, as well as theoretical determination of the parameters that have the greatest influence on the equilibrium sulphur distribution. The conclusion from dynamic modelling is that the vacuum degassing operation can be described dynamically with the present knowledge of sulphide capacity, sulphur distribution, viscosity, and oxide activities of ladle slags if this knowledge is combined with fluid flow modelling to derive the overall kinetics. The presented model approaches have been found useful in understanding the sulphur refining process at Ovako Steel AB.

The steel/slag reaction time and Al 2 O 3 content in slag had a great effect on inclusions characteristics. With the reaction time increasing from 30 to 180 minutes, inclusions experienced a transformation process: from mainly Al 2 O 3 MgO system and MgO based inclusions to spherical CaO MgO Al 2 O 3 system inclusions surrounded by a lower melting temperature surface layer of CaO Al 2 O 3 . Formation and transformation mechanisms of the inclusions were given based on the results. It was also found that with Al 2 O 3 content in slag reduced from 40% to 30%, Mg contents in steel melts were increased and MgO in slag reached saturation, which contributed to the formation of more MgO based inclusions and a more scattered inclusion composition distribution after 90 min reaction.

The morphology, composition, and size evolution of inclusions in steel samples were analyzed in three-dimensional by the electrolytic extraction method and in two-dimensional by the automatic analysis method. The results showed that the Ti content significantly decreased after the slag addition. However, the change of the Si content showed an opposite tendency. The decrease of the Ti content in steel was due to the reduction of SiO 2 and Al 2 O 3 in the slag by dissolved Ti in steel. An increase of the TiO 2 content in the slag can decrease the Ti loss in steel based on the slag-steel kinetic analysis. The total O content in the steel melt decreased from 62 to 26 ppm, and the steel cleanliness was improved, since the number density of inclusions decreased after the slag refining. The results of a kinetic analysis showed that the rate-determining step of the oxidation of Ti in the steel and the reduction of SiO 2 in the slag were the mass transfer on the slag side. In addition, high Ti 2 O 3 -containing inclusions were found to be transformed to Cr 2 O 3 -Ti 2 O 3 -Al 2 O 3 and Cr 2 O 3 -Ti 2 O 3 -SiO 2 system inclusions after the slag addition.

The scope does not include the materials properties of the weld metal. The latter may easily be optimised in the future by changing the weld metal chemistry once the process reactions of different element powders in SAW are understood. Aluminium as de-oxidiser element was applied to SAW to lower the oxygen partial pressure in the process. The results show the Al-Ni-Cr-Co-Cu alloyed weld metal total oxygen content was reduced to 257 ppm O, compared to the base case weld metal at 499 ppm O, made with the same flux and no metal powder additions. Thus, the aluminium that was added as a de-oxidiser element to the SAW process effectively lowered the original flux-induced partial oxygen pressure, both in the arc cavity and at the interface of the molten flux weld pool phases. This partial oxygen pressure lowering effect of Al also prevents oxidation of Cr, preventing loss of Cr to the slag. Carbon steel was alloyed to 3.9% Al, 4.8% Ni, 4.9% Cr, 4.8% Co, 4.7% Cu at 62% Al yield, 76% Ni yield, 77% Cr yield, 75% Co yield, 74% Cu yield. SEM (scanning electron microscope) work on the three-dimensional (3D) post-weld slag sample show dome cavities with 3D rounded structures embedded in the dome cavity walls, as well as shards and nano-strands on the dome cavity walls. The 3D structures indicate vapour formation and re-condensation of oxy-fluorides. The novel application of the EERZ (effective equilibrium reaction zone) model simulates the mass transfer effects in the SAW process. This model is novel because it is the first model used to calculate the gas-slag-metal phase chemistry changes in SAW as a function of welding time. The novel SAW process modification of adding Al de-oxidiser powder with alloying element powders of the unique combination of Co-Cr-Co-Ni-Al was successfully applied. The results confirm that the gas phase and its reactions must be included in the interpretation and modelling of SAW process metallurgy.

This indicates the important role of dicalcium silicate in dephosphorization. To understand the reaction kinetics and identify optimum treatment conditions, it is very important to know the influence of the solid phases in the slag. In this study, a new reaction model for hot metal dephosphorization that considers the effects of dicalcium silicate and the dissolution rate of lime is applied to simulate laboratory-scale experiments.The calculated results are in good agreement with the experimental results for various slag compositions and methods of flux and oxidizer addition. The influence of various factors on the reaction efficiency is discussed using this simulation model. The optimum basicity and combination of stirring energy and oxidizer supply rate are found.

Different polymeric materials i.e., rubber, high-density polyethylene (HDPE), polyethylene therephtalate (PET), and Bakelite , which have different chemical structures and compositions, were selected for this study as carbon resources. The rapid heating to high temperatures provided during steelmaking will break down the polymeric chains and reactions with liquid slag, enabling gas formation. The dynamic changes in the volume of the slag droplet while in contact with the coke/polymer substrates are measured. Significant levels of gas generation and entrapment are present, leading to an improved performance over coke. Carbon/metal reactions were studied by measuring carbon and sulfur pick-up by liquid metal as well as the formation of reaction products at the metal/carbon interface. The measured carbon pick-up value after 2 min of reaction for metallurgical coke was approximately 0.08 wt %, whereas 100% polymers, such as PET and HDPE, showed an increased value of 2 wt %. The proportion of sulfur pick-up was very similar. The formation of interfacial products, in the case of Bakelite coke blends, was studied, and the presence of CaCO3 used as a filler was seen to influence the chemical properties of the carbonaceous substrate. This study has established fundamentals of the interaction of waste polymers with slag and metal in the steelmaking process.

However, high-grade iron ore pellets used in the current direct reduction process will be depleted in the future. On the other hand, steel scraps recovered from society are usually contaminated with tramp elements, which are difficult to remove in the current steel refining processes. To produce high-quality steel from DRI and steel scraps, molten steel composition in the melting process should be optimized considering the impurities originating in iron resources and conditions such as temperature and oxygen potential. In this study, the equilibrium of slag/metal reactions in the steelmaking process using DRI and steel scraps were thermodynamically analyzed, and the effect of using scrap on the composition of molten steel and slag and the conditions to produce low-phosphorous molten steel from high-P content DRI and steel scrap were discussed. The use of steel scrap showed such advantages as a decrease in the concentrations of Si, S, and P originating from high-P DRI, a decrease in the amount of slag, and a reduction in the amount of limestone required to maintain slag basicity. Moreover, the P content of iron can be decreased to 13 mass ppm at 1873K and O2 10-10 atm even when the high-P DRI is used in combination with steel scrap.

The blast furnace and packed bed type partial smelting reduction process (PSR) are the most prospective reactors. When steel scrap is used as an iron source, the hot metal composition should be precisely controlled, because tramp elements such as Cu, Sn, Ni, and Cr are dissolved in hot metal. An analysis model was developed to simulate the equilibrium of the slag metal reaction at the bottom of such reactors. The effect of scrap ratio (iron mass ratio of scrap to scrap and sinter) on hot metal and molten slag composition was thermodynamically analyzed and the optimal composition of hot metal under controlled temperature and PO2 was investigated. Si and Mn were found to be significantly oxidized relative to the equilibrium state, and the S content was equal to that at equilibrium under a blast furnace condition. As the scrap ratio increased, the Si, Mn, and P contents decreased.

Abstract: In this report, oxygen potential, PO2 , at the interface between slag and molten iron of high carbon concentration is estimated from the experimental results of the authors previous kinetic study of phosphorus reaction. The method of the estimation of PO2 is based on an assumption that a quasi-equilibrium is established in the slag-metal system at the time point when the phosphorus reaction changes its direction from dephosphorization to rephosphorization.The estimated PO2 ranges in the order of 10 11 10 10 Pa. The PO2 increases with the increase in Fe3 /(Fe2 Fe3 ) in the slag and decreases with increasing the intensity of mechanical stirring employed in the experiments. The oxygen potential of the bulk slag, PO2, s, is calculated with a regular solution model, and the comparison of the bulk slag s PO2, s with the interfacial oxygen potential, PO2 , shows that PO2 is 2-3 order or magnitude smaller than PO2, s. The slag-metal interfacial oxygen potentials, PO2 , obtained from the experimental data, are also compared with those calculated from a mathematical model which simulates the simultaneous reactions in the gas/slag/metal reaction system including Ar-O2 atmosphere.

The slagging reaction is a necessary process that oxidizes C, Mn, Si, P, S, and other impurities and therefore directly affects the quality of the resultant steel. Relevant research has suggested that intensifying the stirring effect can accelerate the slagging reaction and that the dynamic characteristics of the top blow are the key factor in exploring the related complex physical and chemical phenomena. To address the issue, the standard k- turbulence model and level-set method were adopted in the present work and a fluid dynamics model was developed for a BOF. Accordingly, the slag metal gas emulsion interaction and stirring effect were investigated, and the interference mechanism of a multi-nozzle supersonic coherent jet was revealed. Finally, a self-adjustment method based on fuzzy control is proposed for the oxygen lance. The results indicate that the transfer efficiency of jet kinetic energy at the gas liquid interface is the critical factor for the slagging reaction and that multi-nozzle oxygen lances with a certain twisted angle have important advantages with respect to stirring effects and splashing inhibition. The fuzzy control method predicts that the optimal nozzle twist angle is within the range of 7.2° to 7.8°. The results presented herein can provide theoretical support and beneficial reference information for BOF steelmaking.

The results showed that CAS, RH LIT, and RH processes had better control of low carbon, silicon, and nitrogen than LF process. High cleanliness of LCAK steels could be achieved by all the mentioned refining processes.

In addition, the liquid calcium aluminates have the tendency to be multi-component inclusion. Two types of CaS bearing inclusion could precipitate in a slab during solidification. The favorable modified inclusions deform very well along with steel matrix during rolling process even if they are associated with CaS bearing layer, while the no or low modified Al2O3 based inclusion would be rolled into pieces and the micro-cracks might be generated around the inclusions.

The yield stress change due to baking ( YS) is determined by grain size and dissolved (C N) content. On the other hand, the ultimate tensile stress change due to baking ( TS) depends mostly on the dissolved (C N) content. The locking mechanism of dislocation is discussed in relation to grain size dependence of these properties. The influence of alloying elements (Mn, Si, P) on BH through their metallurgical factors is also studied. Mn decreases YS through the reduction of dissolved C content. Si gives rise to the increase of dissolved C content and grain refining up to 0.5% Si content. Over 0.5% Si content, the grain becomes coarser in turn. Consequently, YS increases up to 0.5% Si content and levels of after that. Though the addition of 0.06% P does not affect the dissolved (C N) content, it gives rise to a little increase of YS through grain refining. Larger grain size dependence of YS is observed at -5ppm of dissolved (C N) content for 0.06% P containing steel. Authors: S.

In this study, the rate of clogging was measured while casting steel through simulated nozzles produced from alumina, zirconia, magnesia, zirconia graphite, and alumina graphite three common base materials and two common carbon containing nozzle materials. Spent nozzles were characterized using optical and cathodoluminescence microscopy. Interactions between the nozzles and steel were not observed in the alumina, zirconia, and zirconia graphite nozzles. Slight interactions were observed in the magnesia nozzles as alumina inclusions within the steel interacted with the nozzle to produce alumina magnesia spinel. Greater amounts of interaction were observed with alumina graphite nozzles. No statistical differences in the mean rate of clogging were observed between all of the pure oxide nozzles and zirconia graphite nozzles. However, the alumina graphite nozzles clogged at a much higher rate than the other nozzles. The higher rate of clogging is thought to be due to refractory steel interactions.

As calcium treatment is also used to modify solid alumina inclusions to liquid or partially liquid calcium aluminates for keeping free from nozzle clogging, a thermodynamic model has been calculated using Factsage to predict the type of calcium aluminates and sulfides present in the steel. The results showed that alumina generated from deoxidation had transformed to MgO Al2O3 spinel with a small amount of CaO by using high basicity and high Al2O3 slag during ladle furnace (LF) refining. Though soft blowing after LF refining is benefit for the removal of inclusions by floatation, vigorous stirring which may make slag layer exposing an eye to air reoxidation should be avoided. After calcium treatment, the inclusions were restricted mainly to globular calcium aluminates and the sulfur in the steel was associated with these inclusions as calcium sulfide. The ND (number density) of inclusions seems to appear a similar tendency to the size distribution of smaller inclusions, and the similar change between the AF (area fraction) of inclusions and the total oxygen content of the steel can be also found by careful comparison.

By this model, it was found that the rate determining step of the reaction was the mass transfer of Mg through the film in molten steel. The increase rate of Mg in molten steel is determined by the activities of soluble oxygen and MgO at the slag/metal interface, and hence by slag composition.3) The unreacted core model was employed to analyze the rate determining step of metal/inclusions reaction.The analysis showed that the rate determining step of the reaction in the case of 20 kg vacuum induction furnace was the diffusion of Mg in molten steel.

This paper presents recent experimental work and analysis of oxide evolution on the surface of Al killed steel melts at oxygen partial pressures of Po 2 1 5×10 5 atm, by using a Confocal Scanning Laser Microscope (CSLM) equipped with a gold image furnace. The effects of gas flow rate (170 300 cm 3 /min) and temperature (1580 1630°C) were investigated. The oxide phase formed on the melt surface was in all cases Al 2 O 3 but not the thermodynamically stable FeAl 2 O 4 . It was found, under the range of experimental conditions in this study, that the rate controlling mechanism for oxide nucleation and growth was gas phase mass transfer of oxygen to the melt surface. The morphology of the oxide changed gradually from distinctly dendritic at low gas flow rates to aggregates as the flow rate was increased.

To assess whether liquid calcium aluminates do agglomerate in liquid steel, laboratory experiments were performed: melting electrolytic iron, deoxidizing the melt with aluminum and subsequently calcium treating the deoxidation products (alumina and magnesia-alumina spinel inclusions). Under laboratory conditions, solid spinels and alumina inclusions were successfully modified, producing a new population of much smaller calcium aluminate inclusions. The new population of inclusions forms because the presence of calcium in the liquid steel destabilizes alumina and MgO-alumina inclusions, which then dissolve into the melt. The liquid inclusions exhibited a weak but statistically significant tendency to agglomerate. Laboratory results were assessed in the light of different collision mechanisms. Agglomeration mainly occurs by Stokes and laminar fluid flow collision when no external stirring is imposed. Monte Carlo simulations of collisions agree reasonably well with experimental results.

Abstract: Laboratory size (4.5-5 kg) low carbon steel melts were deoxidized using Al in zirconia crucibles. Some of these heats were treated with different types of synthetic fluxes to evaluate the oxide inclusion removal and desulfurization characteristics of the respective synthetic fluxes. The sulfur, oxygen and aluminum contents in the steel melt were determined as a function of refining time and temperature. It was observed that the reaction between aluminum and oxygen in solution closely follows thermodynamic equilibrium. Reoxidation of the steel melt occurred through oxygen pick-up from the atmosphere. The extent of this reoxidation was found to be a function of both the oxygen content and the exposed surface area of the steel melt. The effectiveness of calcium-aluminate (12CaO 7Al2O3) based fluxes in protecting the steel melt from reoxidation and in increasing the rate of removal of inclusions was evaluated. Synthetic fluxes and refining techniques were developed to obtain total oxygen level of 10 ppm within the first 10 min of refining. Sulfur removal followed first order reaction kinetics. The effectiveness of calcia saturated calcium-aluminate (12CaO 7Al2O3) based fluxes in desulfurizing the steel melts was evaluated. The effects of adding barium oxide and fluorspar to the flux, the initial sulfur level of the steel melt, and addition of tellurium to the steel melt on the kinetics of desulfurization were also studied.

Through quantitative analysis of fracture surface morphology, it is revealed that the higher crack growth rate in impact fatigue is sustained by the larger amount of intergranular fracture mode which accelarates crack growth rate to some extent. Other characteristical aspects in impact fatigue crack growth behavior are also described in detail.

The yield stress change due to baking ( YS) is determined by grain size and dissolved (C N) content. On the other hand, the ultimate tensile stress change due to baking ( TS) depends mostly on the dissolved (C N) content. The locking mechanism of dislocation is discussed in relation to grain size dependence of these properties. The influence of alloying elements (Mn, Si, and P) on BH through their metallurgical factors is also studied. Mn decreases YS through the reduction of dissolved C content. Si gives rise to the increase of dissolved C content and grain refining up to 0.5% Si content. Over 0.5% Si content, the grain becomes coarser in turn. Consequently, YS increases up to 0.5% Si content and levels off after that. Though the addition of 0.06% P does not affect the dissolved (C N) content, it gives rise to a little increase of YS through grain refining. Larger grain size dependence of YS is observed at5 ppm of dissolved (C N) content for 0.06% P containing steel. Authors: S.

To assess whether liquid calcium aluminates do agglomerate in liquid steel, laboratory experiments were performed: melting electrolytic iron, deoxidizing the melt with aluminum and subsequently calcium treating the deoxidation products (alumina and magnesia-alumina spinel inclusions). Under laboratory conditions, solid spinels and alumina inclusions were successfully modified, producing a new population of much smaller calcium aluminate inclusions. The new population of inclusions forms because the presence of calcium in the liquid steel destabilizes alumina and MgO-alumina inclusions, which then dissolve into the melt. The liquid inclusions exhibited a weak but statistically significant tendency to agglomerate. Laboratory results were assessed in the light of different collision mechanisms. Agglomeration mainly occurs by Stokes and laminar fluid flow collision when no external stirring is imposed. Monte Carlo simulations of collisions agree reasonably well with experimental results. For industrial conditions, where the liquid steel is agitated by argon bubbling and/or electromagnetic stirring, turbulent collisions dominate. Authors: Mauro E. Ferreira, P. Pistorius, R.

During the industrial production of the Al-killed Ca-treated steel, the Al2O3 content in CaO-Al2O3 inclusions increased from 72.05% to 79.83%, after the aluminum addition. In laboratory experiments, the addition of aluminum increased the Al2O3 content, and meanwhile lowered the contents of CaS and CaO in the inclusions. The average diameter of the inclusions decreased and the number density increased after the Al addition in steel, due to the formation of tiny inclusions. Based on the thermodynamic consideration, the transformation of the inclusions was attributed to the re-equilibrium of the reaction between steel and the inclusions after aluminizing. The Al2O3-riched calcium aluminate with a high melting point increased the possibility of the nozzle clogging during the continuous casting process, reducing the effect of the calcium treatment. Therefore, the addition of aluminum after calcium treatment should be avoided as far as possible.

Recognizing the castability of a specific cast by monitoring the condition of the SEN is essential for uninterrupted casting. With this information prior to casting, operators can take preventive action against possible clogging occurrences, thus reducing unplanned downtimes. In response to the severe implications of SEN clogging, this work introduces a novel way to forecast castability of Al killed steels. A hybrid model is proposed that integrates the adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and long short term memory (LSTM) networks. The output of the model helps to anticipate the event of clogging by analyzing both the past condition of the SEN and changes in the steel chemistry during the transport of the steel ladle from refining to the casting process. A comprehensive analysis of 150 casts helped to build the ANFIS algorithm for estimating the castability index (CI) parameter from steel chemistry. LSTM algorithm is used as a subsequent step to forecast castability in the next 20 25 min. Discrepancies between the predictive response and the actual conditions are reported. Although the real time implementation of the proposed model is the ultimate goal, the focus of this work was to present the methodology and demonstrate its potential. Authors: S.

The results showed that non-metallic inclusions experienced the changes from Al2O3 → MgO Al2O3 → CaO Al2O3. During the refining process using either of the two ladle lining materials, for all non-metallic inclusions, the vast majority are distributed in the high Al2O3 area of the CaO Al2O3 MgO phase diagram, with very little or none in the low melting point zone. Non-metallic inclusions are mainly smaller than 3 m, while those larger than 3 m consisted primarily of MgO Al2O3 and CaO Al2O3 inclusions. The use of an Al2O3 MgO Al2O3-lining ladle is more effective in reducing the number density of inclusions in the steel. However, during the refining process, the Al2O3-lining ladle does not have a significant impact on the presence of MgO Al2O3 and CaO Al2O3 inclusions in the molten steel.

It is found that the oxygen activity in liquid steel during LF (Ladle Furnace) refining is confirmed to be determined by the equilibrium between dissolved Al and Al2O3 in inclusion. There are two manners for Al2O3 inclusion modification during LF refining: the first route is followed by Al2O3-low modified calcium aluminates-liquid calcium aluminates; and the other is as Al2O3 MgO Al2O3 spinel-CaO MgO Al2O3 multi-component inclusion. In addition, the liquid calcium aluminates have the tendency to be multi-component inclusion. Two types of CaS bearing inclusion could precipitate in a slab during solidification. The favorable modified inclusions deform very well along with steel matrix during rolling process even if they are associated with CaS bearing layer, while the no or low modified Al2O3 based inclusion would be rolled into pieces and the micro-cracks might be generated around the inclusions.

They can be easily detected by optical microscopy. A nucleus is observed next to a large number of TiN inclusions. A TEM analysis was carried out on a biphasic nucleus composed of a calcium sulfide (CaS) and a spinel (MgAl2O4), surrounded by a TiN particle. An orientation relationship between these three phases was revealed, which suggests a heterogeneous germination of the TiN particle on the nucleus by epitaxial growth. Based on this observation, on thermodynamic considerations and on previous work, a model has been developed and coupled to a numerical simulation of the VAR process to study the formation and evolution of a TiN distribution in the VAR ingot.

To this end, the nitrogen content in the initial metal before its solidification is limited to the calculation level at which titanium nitrides are thermally unstable.

Specimens were machined from the round bars with different diameters. One type was cut from the central area of a thin bar; the other type was cut from the medium area of the radius of a thick bar. As a result of the fatigue tests, the fatigue life of the latter type specimen was longer in the long life region. Crack initiation sites on fracture surfaces of all the failed specimens were observed by means of a scanning electron microscope. The number of alumina inclusions was decreased, and the average size of titanium nitride inclusions on fracture surfaces was smaller for the latter type specimens. And a characteristic rough surface of fine granular area (FGA) was observed in a circle around the inclusion on the fracture surface. The size of FGA tended to increase with an increase of the fatigue life and a decrease of the stress amplitude at the position of the inclusion. From a view point of fracture mechanics, the stress intensity factor range at the front of FGA, KFGA, was calculated for each specimen by using area model. Values of KFGA of both type specimens were almost constant regardless of the stress amplitude at the site of inclusion, and the average value was about 5 MPa m. That is, it seems that the fatigue life of the specimens cut from the thick bar was improved by downsizing the inclusion area on the fracture surface. Authors: Noriyasu OGUMA, B.

The mineralogy and petrography of the CAI and thermodynamic calculations indicate that the osbornite formed by gas-solid condensation in a high-temperature (similar to 2000 K) region of the solar nebula. Because isotopic fractionation at high temperature is small, the measured nitrogen N-15/N-14 (2.356 /- 0.018) x 10(-3) and carbon C-13/C-12 0.01125 /- 0.00008; 1 sigma isotopic compositions of the Isheyevo osbornite are representative of the solar nebula and, hence, of the Sun. This conclusion is supported by the observations that ( 1) the measured C-13/C-12 ratio is indistinguishable from the spectroscopic determination of the C-13/C-12 ratio of the solar photosphere and ( 2) the measured N-15/N-14 ratio of osbornite is in excellent agreement with the Galileo spacecraft measurement of the nitrogen isotopic composition of the Jovian atmosphere, the second largest reservoir of nitrogen in the solar system.

In this paper concerning a project involved in the COST 517 framework, studied alloys are high alloy steels. The raw materials were obtained from the conventionally electrical cast ingot and the Electro Slag Refining processes. The purpose is to compare various inclusions produced by these different processes and their effect on the mechanical properties. The raw material because of the melting processes themselves, leads to a product with a good to a great cleanliness, and tiny inclusions, which are haphazardly distributed. The actual ASTM E45 chart seems to be inappropriate, as the inclusions founded are too small in size. Therefore, we manage to develop a specific procedure for the study of such inclusions. The different types of inclusions encountered are oxides, titanium nitrides, and manganese sulphides. Studying the effect on mechanical properties, oxides often seem to initiate fatigue fracture.

The benefits plasmas provide, however, come at the cost of a complex array of process variables that often challenge the ability to predict, a priori, the influence of any one input parameter. In this work, the authors attempt to provide some clarity as to how plasmas are formed and controlled and how they can most optimally be employed within the framework of atomic layer deposition. To begin, the authors cover some of the fundamentals of plasma generation along with the production of energetic and reactive species and their transport within the plasma. They then focus on how different plasma generation schemes and geometries, often employed in plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposition (PEALD), differ in their production of energetic and reactive species. They also address the plasma-surface interactions that are critical for film growth and control of crystallinity. Throughout this work, the authors use both current experimental data and a review of previously published works to describe how variations in the approach to plasma generation and the interactions between plasma-produced species and the growth surface influence the plasma reactant step in PEALD processes. The authors highlight two case studies to demonstrate how these relationships can be used to control the phase purity of crystalline titanium dioxide (TiO2) films and grow crystalline growth of semiconducting indium nitride (InN).

Oxides, sulfides, silicates and nitrides have been reported to be nuclei for graphite precipitation. Those compounds originate both from the nodulizing treatment and the inoculation process. Previous research works have shown that titanium nitrides or carbonitrides play an active role in graphite nucleation. In order to determine the efficiency and nature of nitrides that can act as nuclei for graphite, and the possible effect of the trace elements added with the inoculant, melts with titanium contents ranging from 0.007% to 0.036% were produced and poured into standard thermal analysis cups, with and without inoculation. Different inoculants rich in titanium, cerium, aluminum or zirconium were used. Two cups were produced with each inoculant, one cooled down to room temperature, and the other quenched in brine immediately after pouring. Nucleation sites were characterized through detector, spectrum, mapping and line scans of a FEG-SEM equipment. Most of the analyzed nuclei exhibited two or three different inclusions: magnesium sulfides or Mg-Ca oxy-sulfides, Mg or Al oxides, and Ti carbo-nitrides or Mg-Si-Al nitrides. The appearance of each type of nitrides is directly related to the titanium content in the base melt. When titanium was added in the inoculant, no titanium nitrides were noticeable. The zirconium added with the inoculant promoted more complex nitrides that appeared in higher amount. Cerium appears occasionally forming sulfides. Aluminum stimulates the formation of complex nitrides. No differences in the nature of the nuclei were observed between the samples quenched and the ones obtained at room temperature, which assures the methodology approach. Authors: G. Alonso, D. M.

The sample was collected at metallurgical dump in Kladno in the early 1970s and briefly described by ek and Ondru (2003). The sample has a size of about 40 × 30 × 30 mm and is notable for its high density and conspicuous cubes of copper-like red to gold colour with metallic lustre (Fig. 1 2). The material consists of dominant gehlenite ( 65% of the sample, all vol. %), osbornite ( 20%), metallic iron ( 8%), oldhamite ( 5%), spinel ( 1%) and anorthite ( 1%), see Fig 3. All these phases were analyzed with the Cameca SX100 electron microprobe, and osbornite by Raman spectroscopy. Gehlenite and osbornite were also confirmed by XRD ( ek Ondru 2003). Gehlenite contains a low concentration of MgO (0.8 1.1 wt.%) and traces of Na2O (0.06 0.16 wt.%) and Fe2O3 (0.4 wt.%). Aggregates of metallic iron embedded in gehlenite contain low titanium (up to 0.06 wt.% Ti) and elevated phosphorus concentrations (0.53 1.59 wt.% P), whereas tiny iron inclusions embedded in osbornite are richer in titanium (1.31 wt.%) and poorer in P (0.37 wt.%). Oldhamite, a cubic CaS, forms rounded inclusions 20 150 m in size embedded in massive gehlenite. It is characterized by elevated concentration of Mn (2.7 wt.%) and low Fe (0.3 wt.%) and Mg (0.15 wt.%). Spinel has empirical formula Mg0.98Al1.99O4, and plagioclase is pure anorthite. Compositional data of osbornite are given in Table 1, those of associated minerals in Table 2 and 3. Osbornite forms aggregates of cubic crystals in a small slag cavity. Individual and crystal aggregates, usually up to 5 mm in size, are embedded in massive gehlenite. The largest aggregate of osbornite crystals reaching about 15 × 8 mm in size (Fig. 2). Osbornite contains 76.30 78.21 wt.% Ti, 21.31 23.82 wt.% N, and 0.02 0.46 wt. % Fe and displays stoichiometric composition Ti0.97 1.03N0.96 1.03 with only 0.005 apfu Fe (see Table 1). Lattice parameter is: a 4.2536(3) A ( ek Ondru 2003). The Raman spectrum of osbornite (Fig. 4) measured on the unpolished surface of cubic crystals showed the following vibrational bands: 1498, 201, 226, 271, 316, 345, 395, 439, 520, 559, 609, 649, 765, 836, and 1075 (all in cm 1). Raman spectra of TiN and other Ti nitrides have been studied by a number of authors (e.g. Spengler et al. 1978, Subramanian et al. 2011, Judek et al. 2021). The spectra can be divided into acoustic (A) and optical (O) part and further to the combination A O, 2A and 2O modes (Spengler et al. 1978; see Fig. 4). In addition to the vibrational bands typical of osbornite (201, 271, 316, 345, 395, 520, 559, 649, 765, 836 and 1075 cm 1), there are also vibrational bands corresponding to rutile and to the TiON phase (149, 226, 395, 439, 520, 609 and 649 cm 1, Spengler et al. 1978, Judek et al. 2021). The position of the vibrational band of osbornite at 201 cm 1 indicates a stoichiometric Ti : N ratio of 1 : 1, which is in agreement with the results of WDS chemical analysis (Spengler et al. 1978). The detected presence of TiON and TiO2 phases on the surface of osbornite crystals indicates oxidation of osbornite, probably at elevated temperatures. A similar effect was achieved during laboratory annealing of TiN layers at temperatures above 250 °C (Glaser et al. 2007) or above 500 °C (Chen et al. 2005). Osbornite had long been considered as an exclusively extraterrestrial mineral (Ramdohr 1973, Casanova 1992), and only a few natural terrestrial localities have been identified so far. It was first detected in heavy mineral concentrates from volcanic breccias at the contact of the Priazov Massif with the Donbas Basin in Ukraine (Tataritsev et al. 1987).

They can be easily detected by optical microscopy. A nucleus is observed next to a large number of TiN inclusions. A TEM analysis was carried out on a biphasic nucleus composed of a calcium sulfide (CaS) and a spinel (MgAl2O4), surrounded by a TiN particle. An orientation relationship between these three phases was revealed, which suggests a heterogeneous germination of the TiN particle on the nucleus by epitaxial growth. Based on this observation, on thermodynamic considerations and on previous work, a model has been developed and coupled to a numerical simulation of the VAR process to study the formation and evolution of a TiN distribution in the VAR ingot. Microsegregation is modeled using the lever rule, while the kinetics of precipitation is mainly driven by the supersaturation of the liquid bath.

The NMIs were analyzed with a Jeol JSM-7900F FESEM-EDS (Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope equipped with Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscope). For automated particle analyses on FESEM, Aztec Feature runs were carried out on polished steel samples, providing the elemental composition, in addition to morphological data, for each observed NMI. Utilizing the obtained EDS analyses, the fractions of oxides (Al 2 O 3 , MnO, TiO x ), manganese sulfide (MnS), and titanium nitride (TiN) in each NMI are estimated with a MATLAB script. Based on the estimated phase contents, a composition-based classification method for the NMIs is presented. To visualize the phase contents of the observed NMIs, the calculated compositions are plotted on MnO TiO 2 Ti 2 O 3 ternary diagrams.

To minimize Ds-type inclusions in steel and improve the production qualification rate of steelmaking plants, a refining slag system optimization scheme was proposed based on the analysis of current inclusion evolution during the steelmaking process, and industrial tests were conducted to verify improvements resulting from application of the proposed scheme. The results showed that the composition of Ds inclusions in 10B21 steel are mainly CaO Al2O3 MgO CaS TiN, which exists in the form of calcium magnesium aluminate coated with titanium nitride and calcium sulfide. The main reason for the formation of Ds inclusions is the poor fluidity of the refining slag and its low capability to absorb inclusions. The poor coverage of the refining slag on the molten steel during refining can easily cause secondary oxidation of the molten steel. Thus, the formation and growth of Ds-type inclusions are aggravated after the calcium feeding line and soft blowing operation. Here, we propose to minimize Ds inclusions using our optimized refined slag system.

In this study, based on a previously proposed model for hot metal dephosphorization, a new simulation model for the steel refining process in BOF is presented. In most cases, steelmaking slag is saturated with dicalcium silicate (C 2 S) and it is well known that C 2 S forms solid solution with tricalcium phosphate (C 3 P) in a wide composition range and the partition ratio of phosphorus between C 2 S and liquid slag is large. On the other hand, C 2 S formed around the lime surface is known as a barrier to lime dissolution into liquid slag. In this simulation model not only the effect of solid phase in slag is considered but also the effects of temperature dependence of variables as well as top and bottom blowing and scrap melting are taken into account. The calculation results are compared with industrial data and the good agreement between experimental and simulation results evidence the validity of this kinetic approach to steel refining process in BOF. Moreover, by using this model the influence of various parameters on the reaction efficiency is discussed. Authors: Farshid Pahlevani, S.

This process involves the creation and dispersion of fine bubbles in molten metals by introducing inert or reactive gas into a turbulent flow region during metal transfer. The highly turbulent metal flow splits the gas into fine bubbles and results in good mixing between the gas and molten metal phases. These conditions are ideal for contacting inclusions in the metal with the bubbles and subsequent flotation of the inclusions to the metal-slag interface where the inclusions are then absorbed by the covering slag layer. Dissolved gases, such as H , O , N , in the metals are also transferred to the gas bubbles and removed from solution. The process can be retrofitted into existing process plants.The process concept has been demonstrated using a full-scale air/water model to simulate the ladle-to-tundish system of continuous casting of steel. At liquid flows typical of those encountered in the caster, fine bubbles smaller than 0.5 mm in diameter can be created and a good mixing between the dispersed gas and the liquid has been achieved.

The effect of initial sulphur content in the top slag on the ration of contribution of transitory desulphurization reaction in total desulphurization was included. The effects of initial sulphur content in the liquid steel, powder injection rate, particle size of powder, flow rate of RH driving gas and initial temperature of the bath on the temperature drop were taken into account.

The lowest sulphur content can decrease to 10 ppm from 30 ppm by taking reasonable injection operating conditions to treat 10 min. The simulated results of sulfur removal rate and final sulphur content in liquid steel agree well with that of plant production under the same conditions, which indicates that the present model can be used to predict desulphurization process.

The term dispersoids refers to oxides, sulphides, nitrides and carbides which are in the 1 m size range and capable of promoting grain refinement during solidification by a process of epitaxial nucleation or in the solid state through intragranular nucleation of ferrite. Such particles are sufficiently small to be harmless from a toughness point of view, but at the same time large enough to act as potent nucleation sites during phase transformation. The dispersoids can either be created by balanced additions of strong oxide and sulphide forming elements to an impure steel melt or be added directly into the liquid steel through a specially designed master alloy containing the nucleating particles. In both cases it is possible to manipulate the steel microstructure in a positive direction, but the latter method, involving the use of a master alloy, has probably a wider industrial application.

Two distinct EAF types were followed up: (1) an eccentric bottom tapping furnace (EBTF) and (2) a spout tapping furnace (STF). Slag samples were collected from 36 industrial heats at three (EBTF) or five (STF) distinct moments in the process. The microstructure of the slag samples was characterised with electron probe microanalysis using energy dispersive spectroscopy (EPMA-EDS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). From the microstructural analysis it is concluded that at the processing temperature the slag consists of a liquid slag matrix, two different types of metallic particles and MgO (Al,Cr)2O3-based spinel particles. The evolution of the microstructure is highlighted, the interactions between the phases are discussed and the effects of changing conditions on the slag microstructure are illustrated by thermodynamic calculations.

The batch studies confirmed that the mixture of limestone and steel refining slag was suitable for stabilization of metals in contaminated soil. The limestone and steel refining slag mixture (2 : 1 and 3 : 2) were used in column studies and it was confirmed that the stabilizers effectively stabilized heavy metals in contaminated soil. The pH of the soil was increased with the addition of stabilizers. Total leached concentration of metals from the column study was reduced 44, 17, and 93% in comparison to the control at arsenic, cadmium and copper, respectively. The sequential extraction studies showed that the exchangeable fraction was changed into carbonate bound fraction (Cd and Cu) and Fe-Mn oxide bound fraction . Based on the results we confirmed that 2:1 ratio of limestone and steel refining slag effectively stabilizes the heavy metals.

A comparison was made between two distinct EAF types: (1) an eccentric bottom tapping furnace (EBTF) and (2) a spout tapping furnace (STF). In order to study the slag evolution during the EAF process, per heat several slag samples were collected at consecutive process stages. They were subjected to electron probe microanalysis using energy dispersive spectroscopy (EPMA-EDS). Compositional and mineralogical data from 36 heats corroborate that both thermodynamic and kinetic conditions exert a strong influence on the final chromium oxide content of the slag. In the STF, chromium oxide reduction predominantly occurs during tapping, owing to the intimate mixing of steel and slag. A multivariate linear regression analysis reveals that the main parameters determining the overall chromium recovery are the slag basicity and the content of dissolved silicon of the steel. These parameters explain 70% of the observed variance in final chromium oxide levels and can be used as control parameters to improve the chromium recovery. For the EBTF, lower chromium recoveries are recorded due to the absence of sufficient mixing during tapping.

Removal of these inclusions occurs in three fundamental stages: flotation, separation and dissolution of the inclusions in supernatant slag. Given that dissolution is subject to the action of slag, this study aims to clarify the inclusion absorption capacity of industrial slags and factors that influence slag properties in absorbing inclusions, as well as the impact of each factor on the cleanliness of the steels analyzed. To that end, the results of industrial steel and slag samples collected during the different stages of secondary refining were analyzed. The amount and chemical composition of the inclusions was determined by SEM/EDS (scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy-dispersive spectroscopy). The chemical composition of slag samples was measured by XRF (X-ray fluorescence) and subsequently submitted to thermodynamic simulations using FactSage 6.4 software. Calculations were made with the SlagViscosityPredictor, which uses FactSage 6.2 software. This made it possible to establish the chemical composition and proportion of the solid phase in the slags and inclusions, as well as the effective viscosity of the slags. The efficiency of absorption inclusion by the industrial slags was found to be greater in the presence of high thermodynamic driving force between slags and inclusions, low slag effective viscosity and when inclusions were not liquid.

A soil stabilization method is an effective and practical remediation alternative for arsenic and heavy metal contaminated farmland soils nearby abandoned metal mine in Korea. This method is a technique whereby amendments are incorporated and mixed with a contaminated soil. Toxic metal bind to the amendments, which reduce their mobility in soil, so the successful stabilization of multi-element contaminated soil depends on the combination of critical elements in the soil and the type of amendments. The objective of this study is to investigate the treatment effects and applicability of limestone (LS) and steel refining slag (SRS) as the amendment for farmland soil contaminated with As and heavy metals, and a lab-column test was conducted for achieving this purpose. The result showed that soil treated with LS and SRS maintained pH buffer capacity and, as a result, the heavy metal leaching concentration was quite low below the water quality standard compared to untreated soil which leachate exceeding the water quality standard was observed, however, the arsenic concentration rather increased with increasing mixture ratio of SRS. This was believed to be related to phosphorus (P) contained in SRS, and dominancy in the competitive adsorption relation between As and P binding strongly to iron might be different according to soil characteristic. We suggested that LS is a effective amendment for reducing heavy metals in soil, and SRS should be used after investigating its applicability based on the adsorption selectivity of arsenic and phosphorus in selected soil.

The understanding of such reactions can help to prevent the formation of unwanted phases and improve the overall high temperature process control. A new approach, namely, the multioxide inclusion kinetic model has been recently developed to simulate steel inclusion reactions in liquid steel. The coupling of this kinetic model with a multicomponent, multiphase steel slag reaction interface model leads to an overall model framework to predict the evolution of steel, slag, and inclusion composition. The current work shows the application of the model to simultaneous deoxidation and desulphurization during ladle refining of Si Mn killed steel. The model shows good performance with industrial data. It is demonstrated that for ladle refining practices, silica rich slags should be strictly used with basicity (CaO/SiO2) between 1 and 1.2 and with Al2O3 content less than 5 wt%. Additional simulations are also carried out to reveal the capability of the model to aid in online process control. Finally, certain limitations of the current model are discussed. Authors: A.

Reoxidation presents substantial challenges to process stability and final product quality. Various sources of reoxidation, including exposure to oxidizing gases, reducible oxides in slag and refractories, and the presence of ferroalloys are explored. Fundamental reactions and their consequences, such as changes in steel composition, inclusion composition/morphology, and the formation of reaction products at the interface between liquid steel and refractory materials, are reviewed. High oxygen partial pressure on the refractory side is identified as a significant factor, particularly in tundish and continuous casting processes. To address reoxidation effectively, the review discusses modeling approaches like computational fluid dynamics and thermodynamic/kinetic modeling. In the industrial context, reoxidation in the tundish is mainly attributed to open eye formation in the tundish flux and reducible oxides like SiO2 in an insulating cover powder, for example, rice hust ash. Maintaining precise tundish flux control is crucial for steel cleanliness. In conclusion, this review highlights the multifaceted nature of reoxidation challenges in clean steel production.

When the soft blowing time reaches over 25 min, the number density and area fraction of large size inclusions increase. The rolling contact fatigue (RCF) life of the forged steel samples is measured using a thrust RCF tester, indicating that the fatigue life of no. 1 steel (vacuum cycle 40 min, soft blowing 20 min) is 12% higher than that of no. 2 steel (vacuum cycle 20 min, soft blowing 40 min). Based on the estimation of the characteristic size of inclusions in the forged steel by the statistics of extreme values (SEV) method, it is concluded that when the characteristic size and the chemical composition of inclusions in steels are similar, the RCF life is increased by 12% when the number density of large size inclusions decreases from 0.63 to 0.44 mm 2.

However, the introduction of Al via steel slag reactions can lead to unwanted inclusion formation, which can cause nozzle clogging down the process line. To simulate steel slag inclusion reactions during the refining of steel, a kinetic model based on the mass transfer of steel species has been developed for MnO SiO 2 Al 2 O 3 inclusions and integrated with a previously developed steel/slag coupled reaction model. Using the model, the rate determining step for inclusion transformation is clarified, and the effect of slag metal reactions on inclusions is investigated. The model calculations are validated using experimental data reported in the literature. Subsequently, the influence of slag compositions on the chemistry of inclusions and the effect of mass transfer coefficient on deoxidation characteristics is examined through a parametric study.

The LF slag is a byproduct from further refining molten steel after coming out of a basic oxygen furnace (BOF) or an electric arc furnace (EAF). The use of the LF slag in further applications requires knowledge of its characteristics. The LF slag characterization in this paper has been performed using the following analytical methods: chemical analysis by energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS), mineralogical composition by X-ray diffraction (XRD), surface area properties by the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) and the Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) methods, surface chemistry by infrared absorption (FTIR) spectroscopy, and morphological analysis by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The results showed that the main compounds are calcium, silicon, magnesium, and aluminium oxides, and calcium silicates under their various allotropic forms are the major compounds in the LF slag. Surface area properties have shown that the LF slag is a mesoporous material with relatively great BET surface area. The ladle furnace slag is a nonhazardous industrial waste because the ecotoxicity evaluation by its eluate has shown that the LF slag does not contain constituents which might in any way affect the environment harmfully.

Calcium treatment somehow modified the inclusions, however, many large inclusions were generated, and the modification effect would be dramatically decreased by the formation of large amount of CaS inclusions, which appeared with three main distribution forms. The formation of inclusions after calcium treatment were discussed based on the thermodynamic analysis.

The expansion test on the soil-LFS mixtures revealed slight swelling, attributable to the pozzolanic reactions of clay minerals with portlandite and brucite in addition to accommodation within the soil-slag pore structure. The cation exchange capacity of clay minerals affects the interaction between soil and LFS; minerals such as montmorillonite, with a high cation exchange capacity, improve the California bearing ratio and reduce the potential expansion.

Thus, this research aims to develop a sustainable binder obtained from LFS as a substitution of hydraulic lime. In this sense, an extensive characterization of the LFS was carried out in its raw and processed forms. Subsequently, all the requirements for hydrated lime and hydraulic lime were verified according to Brazilian and Portuguese standards. Finally, mortars for coating and laying were produced with portland cement, lime, and the sustainable binder, and their main properties were evaluated in the fresh and hardened states. The chemical and mechanical properties of the sustainable binder were closer to those of the hydraulic limes. The obtained results indicate the technical feasibility of the use of LFS as binder for mortars in the replacement of lime.

The paper reports development of a model based advisory system, called ladle furnace on-line reckoner (LFOR), for the prediction and control of temperature and composition of steel in a LF. The thermal and chemistry models employed in the LFOR system are based on simplified physics, material and heat balance, and statistical analysis of plant data. The LFOR system is provided with graphical user interface (GUI) to display the predicted composition and temperature profile. The control advice displayed on the screen provides guidance for arcing and addition to achieve the target temperature and composition. The LFOR system has been commissioned at LF No. 2 of the LD2 and Slab Caster Shop of Tata Steel, Jamshedpur and is designed to meet the requirements of sequence casting as well as to optimise the energy input and cost of alloying additions.

The steelmaking process creates an industrial by-product termed as slag. Ladle furnace slag (LFS) is produced at the final stages of the steelmaking process in ladle refining furnaces. The potential use of LFS as a base/subbase material requires a thorough knowledge of its engineering properties. In this research, an extensive suite of engineering characterization tests were carried out to evaluate the engineering properties of LFS. The effect of curing on the strength of unbound LFS was investigated using unconfined compression strength (UCS) and resilient modulus tests. The results showed that the UCS of unbound LFS increased by almost four times with 7 days of curing in a temperature-controlled and moisture-controlled chamber. The resilient modulus value of unbound LFS increased when increasing either confining pressure or deviator stress. The specimens with 7 and 28 days of curing had higher resilient modulus values than uncured samples, which were substantiated by UCS test results. The curing period was found to play an important role in the UCS development of unbound LFS samples, which was attributed to the relatively high lime content of the material. The chemical composition and microstructure of LFS samples were evaluated using X-ray fluorescence (XRF) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analyses. In terms of usage in pavement-base/subbases, the engineering properties of LFS were found to be equivalent or even superior to typical quarry materials.

Fortunately, the large sample set is accumulated from the practical production process. However, a large sample set makes it difficult to build a liquid steel temperature model.

However, LFS is often stored in large, open surface areas, leading to many environmental issues. To tackle waste management challenges, LFS can be recycled as supplementary cementitious material (SCM) in many cementitious composites. However, LFS contains some mineral phases that hinder its reactivity (dicalcium silicate ( -C2S)) and pose long-term durability issues in the cured cemented final product (free lime (f-CaO) and free magnesia (f-MgO)). Therefore, LFS needs to be adequately treated to enhance its reactivity and ensure long-term durability in the structures of the cementitious materials. This literature review assesses possible LFS treatments to enhance its suitability for valorization. Traditional reviews are often multidisciplinary and explore all types of iron and steel slags, sometimes including the recycling of LFS in the steel industry. As the reuse of industrial by-products requires a knowledge of their characteristics, this paper focuses first on LFS characterization, then on the obstacles to its use, and finally compiles an exhaustive inventory of previously investigated treatments. The main parameters for treatment evaluation are the mineralogical composition of treated LFS and the unconfined compressive strength (UCS) of the final geo-composite in the short and long term. This review indicates that the treatment of LFS using rapid air/water quenching at the end-of-refining process is most appropriate, allowing a nearly amorphous slag to be obtained, which is therefore suitable for use as a SCM. Moreover, the open-air watering treatment leads to an optimal content of treated LFS. Recycling LFS in this manner can reduce OPC consumption, solve the problem of limited availability of blast furnace slag (GGBFS) by partially replacing this material, conserve natural resources, and reduce the carbon footprint of cementitious material operations.

Since the current literature lacks systematic studies on the mechanical performance of mixtures of soil, ladle furnace slag (LFS) and fly ash (FA), this research investigated the chemical stabilization of two different soils (clayey or sandy soil) using a concomitant mix of distinct types of industrial wastes: LFS and FA. A design of experiments (DoE) methodology was employed to systematically generate distinct mixtures for each soil sample, utilizing a simplex-centroid design. The mixtures were subjected to unconfined compressive strength (UCS), California Bearing Ratio (CBR) and resilient modulus (RM) tests. The industrial by-products improved the mechanical properties of the soils, providing UCS, CBR index and RM increases up to 130.5%, 324.4% and 132.6%, respectively. Synergistic and antagonistic effects related to the combination of different wastes were discussed, based on mathematical models with coefficients of determination ranging from 0.760 to 0.998, in addition to response surfaces generated for each response variable. The desirability function was applied to identify the optimal component proportions. The best mixture proportion was 80% soil, 20% LFS and 0% FA, which improved the formation of cemented compounds that contributed to the enhanced mechanical strength. The use of industrial waste for soil stabilization has therefore proven to be technically feasible and environmentally friendly. Authors: M. H. R. Rodrigues, T. Silva, H.

Corresponding experiments were conducted to provide insights into the flow field, which were used for the validation of CFD simulations. The correlation between the flow structure and turbulence kinetic energy in relation to mixing time was investigated. Flow field results indicated that both turbulence models aligned well with time-averaged velocity data from the experiments. However, the LES model not only offered a closer match in magnitude but also provided a more detailed representation of turbulence eddies. With respect to predicting mixing time, increased flow rates resulted in extended mixing times in both turbulence models. However, the LES model consistently projected longer mixing times due to its capability to capture a more intricate distribution of turbulence eddies.

This aim was extended to study the applicability of using these geopolymers as a catalyst for the production of biodiesel. Geopolymers were prepared in multiple batches using fly ash and ladle slag in the presence of an alkali solution. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR) were used to assess the phase identification of the manufactured geopolymers. The apparent porosity and bulk density as physical properties of the processed materials were evaluated. In addition, a compressive strength test was conducted. A trial was carried out utilizing the calcined geopolymer powders at varying temperatures (110-700 o C), as a catalyst in the production of biodiesel. This process was achieved in the presence of soybean oil and methanol. The kinetic viscosity, flash point, and density of the prepared biodiesel were measured to assess its efficiency. The gained results showed that ladle slag and fly ash could be effectively used to manufacture geopolymer bulk materials. The density and compressive strength of the prepared geopolymers were improved by increasing the fly ash content in the batches. The batch containing 30% fly ash and 70% slag exhibited the highest compressive strength (14.5 MPa) of the developed geopolymers. In addition, the generated biodiesel s viscosity, flash point and density measurements fell within the expected ranges of 2.8-5.1 mm 2 /s, 90-135 °C and 0.848-0.885 g/cm 3 , respectively.

Its binding properties are enhanced in the presence of siliceous materials, such as metakaolin (MK), forming a ternary mixture that can directly replace ordinary Portland cement (OPC). However, despite this blend having already been evaluated in alkali-activated mixtures, knowledge about this mixture in situations of direct replacement of OPC by slag is still lacking. This study evaluates the synergistic effects of combining LFS and MK in cementitious mortars. Due to an insufficient hydration reaction observed in the short term, this study focuses on assessing the long-term performance of these mortars. Both the fresh and hardened states at 28 and 180 days are evaluated, and the resulting microstructural characteristics and constituent phases are also examined. After 180 days of curing, the mortar with MK exhibits superior binding activity compared to the results at 28 days. Although the nominal resistance does not show a clear advantage with the application of MK, a significant reduction in the porosity of the mortar is observed. Microstructural analysis indicates that the addition of MK increases the hydration compounds when mixed with LFS. Importantly, the sample containing MK and LFS showed a 42% reduction in cement consumption, highlighting the potential for resource efficiency. Thus, this study contributes to promoting a circular economy between the steelmaking and civil construction sectors. Authors: T. Silva, E. Souza, E.

Ladle furnace (LF) refining is a feasible step for scrap steel utilisation, which is often overlooked and relied solely on empirical adjustment, resulting in difficulty of precise control. It is necessary to conduct in-depth research on this process using scientific methods and explore the impact of scrap steel addition on other materials. A comprehensive calculation model was established by scientifically investigating material and thermal balances in the LF process in this article, and the impact of initial steel and scrap compositions, temperature, mass and price of scrap on production costs were analysed and compared based on the model. The results showed that as the carbon and silicon content in the initial steel increase by every 0.01% could on average reduce the production cost per ton of steel by 4.013 CNY and 0.8473 CNY, respectively, and increases by 0.123 CNY as the sulphur content increase every 0.001%. The impact of scrap composition on costs is similar to that of the initial molten steel. Increasing the carbon and sulphur content in scrap by every 0.01% will on average increase costs by 0.0765 CNY and 0.01 CNY, respectively. When the price difference between scrap and the crude steel price is within 450 500 CNY/t, increasing scrap addition will create more profit. The relative reduction in smelting time is 7.97 s as the scrap temperature increases every 50°C. The present study holds academic and industrial significance in improving LF efficiency and promoting the LF process towards a more sustainable direction. Authors: Jianhao Wang, Q.

The control algorithm for the electrical mode of LF with adaptation to the mode of argon purging and slag mode using the slag coefficient is considered. It is noted that for the algorithm operation it is necessary to form a set of operating curves, providing the possibility of timely shortening of electric arc lengths depending on the influence degree of the liquid metal mirror on specific phases for different configurations of LF and different purging modes. The main disadvantages of this algorithm are formulated. As an elimination of the main disadvantage of the adaptation algorithm for the electric mode to the conditions of argon purging the application of a digital double is proposed. The improved control system of the ladle-furnace unit with application of the digital twin is developed. It is noted that the systems for setting the asymmetrical mode of arc burning and automatic switching of operating curves and tap changers of the furnace transformer are separated in this system and function in parallel with each other, which provides the flexibility of setting the electrical mode of the LF.

The aim is to define whether additions of this by-product to clayey soil can stabilize the soil in accordance with the technical specifications of Spanish standards. To do so, three different soils stabilized with 5% LFS were compared with the same soils stabilized with 2% lime and with no stabilization, in order to investigate their different behaviors. The chemical and mineralogical characterizations of all the soil mixes were conducted using X-ray fluorescence, X-ray diffraction, and scanning electron microscopy. The Atterberg limit test was used to study the plastic behavior of the soils, and the results of compaction, bearing capacity, unconfined compressive strength, and direct shear strength (cohesion and friction angle) tests defined their strength characteristics. The analysis was completed with the pH monitoring of the mixes along the curing time in order to relate the pH changes with the strength evolution. The addition of LFS to the soils has resulted in an increase in the liquid limit and plastic limit, causing therefore a slight decrease in the plasticity index. All the soils showed increases between 30% and 70% in their California Bearing Ratios immediately after mixing with 5% LFS, and after 90 days of curing, improvements of 30 188% in their unconfined compressive strength were noted in comparison with untreated soil, which were higher than the lime-stabilized soils. The cohesion of soils stabilized with LFS at 28 days of curing obtained improvements ranging from 40 to 300% depending on the type of soil. However, the friction angle showed a slight increase of 10% in two of the soils and zero in another. The high initial pH in LFS-stabilized soils was maintained during the curing time, which favored the development of pozzolanic reactions that improve the soil strength. These results confirmed that the substitution of lime with LFS is a feasible option for soil stabilization. Authors: A. B. Espinosa, V.

This research evaluated both properties at 28, 90, and 180 days in concrete mixes produced with 5%, 10%, and 20% of two LFS types, both stabilized and non-stabilized. The relationship between them was then analyzed through these experimental results by adopting a statistical approach. A three-way analysis of variance revealed that both properties were affected by LFS differently. Thus, the effect of each LFS content on both features varied depending on its composition and pre-treatment. Furthermore, the effect of the LFS content on the compressive strength was also influenced by the age of the concrete. These facets implied that when analyzing the relationship between both mechanical properties, the monotonic correlations were stronger than the linear ones, reaching values between 0.90 and 1.00. Therefore, the double reciprocal regression models were the most precise ones for expressing the modulus of elasticity as a function of compressive strength. The model accuracy was further enhanced when discriminating based on the LFS type and introducing concrete age as a predictive variable. With all these considerations, the average deviations between the estimated and experimental values of 1 3% and the maximum deviations of 4 7% were reached, as well as R2 coefficients of up to 97%. These aspects are central to the further development of LFS concrete models. Authors: V. Revilla-Cuesta, Roberto Serrano-L pez, A. B.

It is a dusty material that has been considered industrial waste. Technical advancements towards a sustainable industry led to the development of different applications for ladle slag. Depending on the processing methods during the steel slag production and the weathering of the slag post production, the elemental composition of the steel slag largely varies. Owing to this, its characteristics cannot be generalized and specific applications depending on the sources are developed. It is generally used in construction materials, soil rejuvenation, and CO2 capture. This paper reviews the production process, the mineralogical and morphological properties, stabilization techniques, and the applications of ladle furnace (LF) slag. One of the prime focuses of waste remediation and sustainable industry is to find meaningful ways to turn waste into products. In this respect, a comprehensive review of the properties of LF slag and its current application will help provide a framework for the development of future sustainability goals.

The effect of the synthesis conditions on the crystalline phases of the zeolite molecular sieves was investigated by XRD. The results showed that the best zeolite molecular sieves were prepared with an LFS: FA ratio of 4: 6, a curing temperature of 40 °C, a curing time of 12 h, a sodium silicate modulus of 1.4, a NaOH concentration of 4 mol/L, a hydrothermal temperature of 120 °C, and a hydrothermal time of 12 h.

The results showed that the synthesized zeolite molecular sieves had mesoporous properties, and the degree of polymerization and cross-linking of the silica-aluminate gel were enhanced after hydrothermal treatment.

Seeking to study its function as a supplementary cementitious material, the objective of this work was to determine the properties of coating mortars with the replacement of Portland Cement (PC) by 30% LFS combined with the pozzolanic effect of Rice Husk Ash (RHA). Prismatic specimens were produced in a 1:6 mixture proportion (PC:sand) and subjected to mechanical tests and determination of the dynamic modulus of elasticity. The results indicated that the replacement provided a reduction in mechanical strength, however the presence of LFS RHA was beneficial to improve water retention. These changes were caused by the bigger surface area of RHA grains and the higher CaO content, in relation to the reference mixture. Authors: E. Souza, T.

The species transport equation is solved to analyze the kinetic behavior and chemical content variation in the melt. The sulfur distribution ratio is calculated based on the slag sulfide capacity and oxygen activity. Subsequently, the solutions are coupled by introducing the species transfer and source terms generated by comparing the initial and predicted thermodynamic equilibrium states at the steel slag interface cell. The model is validated by experimentally comparing the sulfur content. Furthermore, the model is applied under different kinetics and thermodynamics conditions. With an increase in the gas flow rate, the in phase effective diffusion coefficient increases, but the number of interface cells involved in the sulfur transfer process decreases. The complex relationship between the desulfurization process and the gas flow rate results from the mutual antagonism between these two factors. Moreover, the study findings demonstrate that a higher slag basicity enhances the calculated sulfur distribution ratio and final desulfurization ratio.

Full-order model (FOM) steady-state simulations were conducted under both isothermal and non-isothermal conditions to assess the influence of thermal buoyancy on the flow characteristics. The results show that buoyancy effects under non-isothermal conditions have a negligible impact on the overall velocity field. The converged flow fields serve as initial conditions for transient tracer transport simulations, enabling evaluation of RTD curves and volume partitioning. A Galerkin projection-based reduced-order model (ROM) is developed to efficiently derive RTD curves. Comparison of RTD curves from experiments, FOM simulations, and ROM predictions demonstrates strong agreement, with both computational approaches closely matching experimental data. A parameter-time dependent ROM is subsequently developed using Galerkin projection and operator interpolation. This enables efficient evaluation of RTD curves across varying parameter values with significantly reduced computational cost compared to full-order simulations.

Efficient prediction of grade intermixing during ladle changeover operations is critical for maintaining steel quality and minimizing material losses in the continuous casting process. Among various factors influencing grade intermixing, operating parameters play a significant role, in addition to tundish geometry and flow control devices. In this study, three-dimensional, transient, two-phase turbulent flow simulations are conducted to investigate the ladle changeover operation. During this process, the molten steel level in the tundish typically varies over time, significantly affecting the grade intermixing phenomena. The influence of ladle change time on intermixing time has been presented. However, high-fidelity full-order simulations of such complex transient phenomena are computationally expensive and are impractical for real-time monitoring or design-space exploration in industrial-scale applications. To address this issue, a reduced order modelling approach based on proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) and reservoir computing (RC) is employed to efficiently predict intermixing time. The proposed reduced order model (ROM) demonstrates excellent predictive accuracy using limited training data while requiring significantly less computational resources and training time. The results demonstrate the potential of the proposed methodology as a fast, reliable tool for real-time process monitoring and optimization in industrial continuous casting operations.

Abstract: Considerable efforts have been made in academia and industry over the last two decades to fully exploit and enhance the metallurgical performance of continuous casting tundish systems. Towards these goals, numerous physical and mathematical modelling studies embodying both industrial and water model tundishes have been carried out and reported in the literature. Based on an extensive literature search, we now present a summary, discussion and analysis of these. For the sake of convenience and clarity of presentation, the studies have been categorised into three major groups: (1) physical modelling (2) mathematical modelling and (3) combined physical and mathematical modelling. In each of these categories, a great number of publications on various aspects of tundish metallurgy, such as, modelling criteria, turbulent fluid flow, residence time distributions (RTD), inclusion transport and separation, heat loss and temperature drop, grade transition and intermixing, etc. have been reported. These works have lead to considerable improvements in our understanding of the various transport processes (viz, RTD, inclusion float out, thermal energy transport, etc.) associated with tundish operations. Comprehensive and sufficiently reliable mathematical models are also currently available and these also allow one to carry out full scale predictions and useful engineering design and process calculations. None the less, certain obscurities and uncertainties remain. These are reviewed together with suggestions of areas where further research is needed. Authors: Dipak Mazumdar, R. I. L.

By applying the reaction rate model of oxidation by air which was developed on the basis of the basic experiment, the amount of oxidation by air in the tundish has been predicted successfully.

In this work a theoretical study of the separation of solid inclusions, alumina and others, at the steel-slag interface applied to the actual conditions in the tundish has been carried out. The theoretical model is based on the equation of motion with the following forces acting on an inclusion as it tries to cross the interface between the metal and the slag; buoyant, added mass, rebound and drag force. A sensitivity analysis study was carried out in order to clarify which of the parameters in the model that had the largest influence on the inclusion displacement. The results showed that the interfacial tensions ( MI, IS, MS) and the slag viscosity ( S) have the largest influence on the predicted displacement. It was also concluded that the overall wettability should be positive and that the slag viscosity should be as low as possible to obtain the most favorable conditions for inclusion transfer at the steel-slag interface.

Two independent overviews, published, respectively, in 1999 and 2010, summarize a large number of research work reported by various groups of investigators. These indicate that modeling of tundish metallurgy is primarily restricted to the steady operating period, and phenomena such as, fluid flow, turbulence, thermal and material mixing, inclusion floatation, and removal etc. are given wide attention. Toward this, homogeneous, turbulent flow modeling is relatively more frequent. Since 2008 or so, transient and multi phase modeling of tundish metallurgy are popular and reported by some groups of investigators. This paper presents a brief summary and a critical assessment of such efforts vis a vis industrial tundish metallurgy practices. Despite advancements in theory and powerful computational procedures, it is brought out that progress in mathematical modeling of tundish metallurgy, particularly during the last decade, is somewhat sluggish. In the final section of the manuscript, an account of continuing efforts of the author and his associates are presented, wherein, modeling of two phase flows in ladle shroud and latter s attendant influences on the metallurgical performance of steelmaking tundish is discussed.

Beside this, these also create the surface directed flow and maximize the residence time available for the flotation of inclusions and assimilation of the reaction products from the molten steel into the slag phase. These can be products of deoxidation, reoxidation, precipitation, emulsification and/or entrainment of refractory components into the melt and thus encompass both indigenous and exogenous inclusions. To this end, both the numerical and physical simulations were carried out mainly for three cases: a) in absence of flow control devices (i.e., bare tundish), b) in the presence of a dam, and c) with the application of turbulence inhibiting device (TID) and dam combination in the existing tundish configuration. The commercial CFD (computational fluid dynamics) package FLUENT was used to predict the flow field prevalent in the water model tundish at steady state, whereas in the experimental program, both Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) techniques for flow measurements and tracer dispersion experiments for concentration measurements were applied in the present study. Among all types of configurations applied in the present study, a combination of TID with holes a dam work reasonably found to be an optimum configuration of the four-strand tundish regarding inclusion floatation.

Results of residence time distribution (RTD) measurements and laser-optical measurements (Laser Doppler Anemometry LDA, Digital Particle Image Velocimetry-DPIV) are used to validate the numerical results for water before the numerical simulation is transferred to the steel melt. The investigations are focused on both steady-state and transient casting conditions. To reduce vortexing and turbulence in the tundish different types of turbo-stoppers are installed in the water models and their influence on the spacious flow structure is discussed. The turbo-stopper produces higher turbulence in the inlet region of the tundish, but this region is spatially more limited in relation to the flow without turbo-stopper. Thereby a more homogeneous flow is created at the outlet of the tundish with better conditions for particle separation. Basic design criteria for the geometry of a turbo-stopper are developed. Moreover, the processes of first tundish filling and ladle change are simulated at a downscaled water model and these results are compared with numerical simulations using a Volume of Fluid (VoF) model.

These included, a two-strand slab casting tundish, a six-strand billet casting tundish and a five-strand, skewed, delta shaped tundish. Plant scale operating conditions were scaled down respecting both geometric and Froude similarity and on the basis of the latter, the inflow rate of water into the model tundish systems was estimated via: Qm 5/2Qf.s. To quantify the hydrodynamic performance, residence time distribution (RTD) characteristics were measured using the conductivity measurement technique for a wide range of baffle designs. From such measurements as well as from flow visualisation studies, the following general observations have been made. The optimum design of baffles together with its number and position within the tundish appear to be a strong function of the basic tundish design (viz., the geometry, the number of operating strands etc.). Of the various types of baffles investigated in this work (dam, dam weir, baffles with holes etc.), appropriately designed slotted baffles appear to modify the RTD characteristics most favourably towards superior metallurgical performances. Increase in the number of strands, asymmetricity in the tundish design and flawed operating conditions, (viz., large width to length ratio) were all found to influence the tundish performance adversely. A comparison of experimental results for the three tundish systems indicated that changing the characteristics of the baffle design can lead to significant performance improvement in the case of the two symmetric tundish systems (e.g., the two and the six strand tundishes), the five strand skewed, delta shaped tundish was, however, found to be somewhat insensitive to such changes. For such a tundish geometry, no design of the flow-modification devices tried, could bring the hydrodynamic performance any closer to the best results obtained for the two other tundish systems. Possible reasons for such observations are discussed in the text.

The liquid steel flow velocity fields in the former tundish and the optimal one with a turbulence inhibitor and newly-designed baffles were numerically calculated and the flow characteristics in the two cases and other tundish configurations were measured in the physical modeling. The results in the physical modeling experiments showed that large difference in the Residence Time Distribution (RTD) curves of two outlets in one side of the former configuration tundish existed. It was found from the numerical calculation of the velocity fields in the tundishes that with the former tundish configuration velocities and turbulent degree of the liquid steel flow in the impact zone of the tundish were large due to the high velocities of liquid steel from the long shroud of the ladle, which caused in lining corrosion and slag entrapment due to the surface eddies. Asymmetric velocity field in the tundish with the former baffles formed and short circuit flow existed in one side of the four-strand tundish. For the optimal configuration of the tundish with a turbulence inhibitor and newly-designed baffles, very similar RTD curves of the two outlets in the same side of the tundish were achieved. The velocities and turbulent degree in the impacting zone of the tundish were depressed and quiet and symmetric molten steel flow was obtained. Eddies on surface and short circuit flow in the optimal tundish disappeared. Such improvement of liquid steel flow in the tundish would increase the ability of inclusion removal.

Abstract: Fluid flow and heat transfer of liquid steel in a two-strand tundish of a slab caster were analyzed using water modeling and numerical techniques. Three cases were considered: A bare tundish, a tundish equipped with a pair of weirs and a pair of baffles (arrangement W B) and a tundish equipped with a turbulence inhibitor and a pair of baffles (arrangement TI B). The water modeling, under isothermal conditions, indicated the existence of a strong bypass-flow for the bare tundish and the W B arrangement while the TI B arrangement reported a longer minimum residence time and higher plug flow characteristics. Numerical results verified the trend mentioned with the water model. The numerical study showed also that cold and hot steel affected considerably the flow patterns of steel due to the existence of buoyancy forces. In the case of a step-input of cold steel, bypass-flow was intensified for the bare tundish and the tundish with a W B arrangement. When a step input of hot steel is introduced into the system buoyancy forces make the steel to flow preferentially near the free surface. The tundish with a TI B arrangement showed the best flow characteristics with not splashing and negligible turbulence. This arrangement shows a slower response to thermal disturbs coming from the input making the tundish a less exposed reactor to the temperature changes and the consequent changes in flow patterns usually found in real casting operations.

The aim this study was to improve the casting conditions by proposing the optimal equipment of the tundish working space. For economic reasons, only the variants with different baffles configurations were considered. It was also dictated by the simplicity of construction and the possibility of its implementation by the base operating steel mill. In the current study, industrial plant measurements and mathematical modeling were used. Industrial experimental data were used to diagnose the current state of the industrial tundish and then validate the numerical simulations. After this, the influence of different baffle configurations installed in the tundish on the steel flow characteristic was modeled mathematically. Residence time distribution (RTD) curves are plotted, and individual flow shares for the investigated tundish were estimated based on the curves. Finally, the industrial plant was rebuilt according to the numerical results and additional plant measurements were performed. A result of the appearance of the baffles in the tundish working space was the reduction of the transient zone extent. The results indicate the increasing share of the dispersed plug flow and a decreasing share of the dead volume flow, with a practically unchanging share of well-mixed volume flow in the modified tundish.

The flow uniformity for all strands is evaluated through variance analysis of the RTD curves in different tundish cases. Besides, the tracer dispersion experiment was performed to visualize the fluid flow under the effect of the gas curtain. In order to investigate the effect of a gas curtain on the flow in the tundish, mathematical simulations were carried out mainly for two cases with or without gas bubbling curtains. The RTD curves were obtained from the species transport model. The results obtained show that gas bubbling curtains can help improve fluid flow characteristics in multi-strand tundish, and that the location of the curtains plays a key role in optimizing multi-strand tundishes configuration. Gas bubbling curtains can decrease the differences in residence times and molten steel temperatures at different outlets in multi-strand tundishes effectively.

Models in Numerical Simulation of Swirling Flow Tundish Abstract: Because of the introduction of a cylindrical swirling chamber into a neotype tundish, the Swirling Flow Tundish (SFT), the numerical simulation becomes difficult for this kind of tundish by the standard two-equation k- turbulence model. So another kind of k- turbulence model, the Renormalization Group (RNG) k- turbulence model derived from the theory of renormalization group, was adopted and compared with the standard one. Both of these two kinds of turbulence models were used to simulate the flow patterns in SFT on staggered grid systems based on Finite Volume Method (FVM) with SIMPLER algorithm for steady 3D and incompressible Newtonian turbulent flows. The comparison of simulation results from these two models shows that the RNG k- turbulence model for SFT leads quicker convergence than the standard one. Unsymmetrical flow patterns were obtained and the grid independence of this mathematical model for SFT was also discussed. The theoretical analyses of forces on particle, turbulent kinetic energy distribution and lower flow velocity behind dam and weir show that there will be a good effect for non-metal inclusion aggregation and separation with the swirling chamber.

Abstract: Mixing phenomena in a six strand billet caster tundish has been studied by numerically solving the Navier Stokes equations along with the species concentration equation in a boundary fitted coordinate system comprising the geometry of the tundish. The solution of the species concentration equation has been utilized to compute the mix, dead and plug volume of the tundish under different flow conditions. The numerical procedure and solution algorithm has been first verified by comparing the numerically obtained residence time distribution curve, which agree well with that of the experiments done for a single strand bare tundish by Singh and Koria.44) It has been observed that the ratio of the mix to dead volume for the six strand tundish has a maximum value for a particular position of the outlets. At that particular position of the outlets (where mixing is best), an APB is placed on the bottom of the tundish surrounding the incoming inlet jet and the height of the APB has been varied to see the effect on mixing in the tundish. It has been observed that the ratio of mix to dead volume further increases with the use of APB and attains a peak value after which it decreases with the increase of the height of the APB signifying the existence of an optimum APB height. At this optimum height of the APB, the shroud immersion depth was made to change from 0 to 400 mm. It was also observed that there exists an optimum immersion depth of the shroud where the ratio of mix to dead volume still attains another peak signifying still better mixing. However, increasing the immersion depth to higher values spoils mixing significantly.

The tundish plays a major role in the challenging task of clean steel production. That means the smallest number of inclusions and high cleanliness in all steel grades after changing the conditions at the inlet of the tundish. Inclusions hinder the metal forming process and lead often to fatigue. The cleanliness of steels is important to fulfil the customer s requirements. In the present study inclusion removal was simulated in a 1:3 scaled water model of a single-strand tundish for the production of stainless steels with a particle counter. The particle counter is capable of counting a large number of particles with a wide range of diameters. The separation rate for particle diameters from dP 1 - 250 m was determined with a counter for the water model tundish. With similarity conditions for the particles this deposition rate can be transformed to the melt flow in a steel tundish. The separation rate was measured for different flow rates in the water model tundish. A larger flow rate decreased the separation rate. Additionally, the separation rate for the tundish fitted with an impact pad was measured and showed a significant increase of separation for particles with a smaller diameter. Furthermore, the particle distribution in the tundish for different size groups of particles was investigated with and without an impact pad. Numerical simulations were carried out with the finite-volume commercial code FLUENT using the realizable k-e turbulence model. A special boundary condition for the separation of particles at the surface was implemented. Authors: Antje R ckert, M.

To control the composition of inclusions, a thermodynamic calculation model was developed. And, to elucidate the characteristics of floating separation of large inclusions in the tundish, tests using the water model were conducted. The following results were obtained:(1) The inclusions in stainless steel were caused by the AOD slag suspended in the molten steel which is not removed in the tundish but carried over into the cast shapes.(2) The thermodynamic calculation model in which the suspended slag is considered was developed. The composition of inclusions could be predicted by this model. In the actual process, the precipitation of MgO-Al2O3 spinel in inclusion was prevented by reducing the MgO and Al2O3 contents of the AOD slag.(3) For the removal of large inclusions in the tundish, an increase in residence time is particularly effective.

Eventual reactions between steel and slag in the tundish were examined by equilibrium calculations. Interfacial phenomena controlling inclusion removal and dissolution into tundish slag were investigated by applying several experimental techniques. Dissolution of alumina and spinel inclusions into slag were studied by model experiments applying CLSM and DHTT methods. Viscosity of slags was measured at different temperatures. Interfacial tension between steel and slag was measured by drop weight method for several slag/steel systems. The study showed the complexity and multi disciplinarity in designing slags which can efficiently absorb macro and micro inclusions from different steels and at the same time act as protective cover against reoxidation and thermal losses. The final conclusion was that slag optimization is a challenging issue on which favorable metallurgical and thermal properties should be combined with long lasting effect during sequential casting operation.

In addition, the mathematical model for the inclusions collision growth under the induction heating condition is also established based on the force balance. The results show that, compared with the traditional tundish, the turbulence intensity of liquid steel is higher in the channels of the new tundish and quite uniformly distributes in the discharging chamber. For those lower sized inclusions smaller than 50 m, the channels in the new tundish have a significantly higher inclusion removal rate than those in the traditional tundish, and the most inclusions absorbed by the channels of the traditional tundish are in the size range of 50 60 m, while they are 50 60 m and 60 70 m for the new tundish. For each of the seven inclusion sizes, the removal rate of inclusions in the new tundish is quite higher than that in the traditional tundish. Compared to the traditional tundish, the inclusions removed in other areas in the new tundish are lower than those removed by the channels. When inclusions of all seven sizes are put into the two tundishes, the inclusions removal rate in the new tundish is also significantly higher than that in the traditional tundish. Under the same heating power, the new tundish is more efficient than the traditional tundish on inclusions removal.

The solution of the species continuity equation predicts the time evolution of the concentration of a tracer at the outlet of the tundish. The numerical prediction of the tracer concentration has been made with nine different turbulence models and has been compared with the experimental observation for the tundish. It has been found that the prediction from the standard k model, the k Chen Kim (ck) and the standard k with Yap correction (k Yap), matches well with that of the experiment compared to the other turbulence models as far as gross quantities like the mean residence time and the ratio of mixed to dead volume are concerned. It has been found that the initial transient development of the tracer concentration is best predicted by the low Reynolds number Lam Bremhorst model (LB model) and then by the k RNG model, while these two models under predict the mean residence time as well as the ratio of mixed to dead volume. The Chen Kim low Reynolds number (CK low Re) model (with and without Yap correction) as well as the constant effective viscosity model over predict the mixing parameters, i.e. the mean residence time and the ratio of mixed to dead volume. Taking the solution of the k model as a starting guess for the large eddy simulation (LES), a solution for the LES could be arrived after adopting a local refinement of the cells twice so that the near wall y could be set lower than 1. Such a refined grid gave a time independent solution for the LES which was used to solve the species continuity equation. The LES solution slightly over predicted the mean residence time but could predict fairly well the mixed volume. However, the LES could not predict both the peaks in the tracer concentration like the k , RNG and the Lam Bremhorst model. An analysis of the tracer concentration on the bottom plane of the tundish could help to understand the presence of plug and mixed flow in it.

The molten steel in the tundish channel has a rotating velocity under the off-centre electromagnetic force.

The temperature distribution in the cross-sections is almost stable, and the maximum temperature increases by 30.1°C. Molten steel runs upward after flowing past the tundish channel, whose density decreases because of IH. The upward motion changes when the electromagnetic force acts on the molten steel.

Besides, the collision and coalescence of inclusions and adhesion to the lining solid surfaces were also taken into account. The Brownian, Stokes and turbulent collision were clarified, separately.

Continuous casting tundishes provide an important link between the ladle and the caster and the parameters of liquid metal in the tundish get affected by both up-stream and down-stream processes.In this paper, the variation of tundish temperature under the influence of various operating parameters is numerically simulated using a mathematical model. A two-dimensional mathematical model, based on coupled fluid flow and heat transfer, is developed to simulate the tundish operation. The model accounts for turbulent fluid flow and dynamic level changes in the tundish. The model is validated with data published in the literature as well as with data obtained during the plant campaign. Simulation of the tundish operations demonstrates the capability of the model in capturing process dynamics correctly. The effect of a few important process parameters on the tundish outlet temperature is also studied. Authors: R. Pardeshi, Srijani Basak, Amarendra K.

In the present work, a three-dimensional mathematical model has been used to study the fluid flow characteristics in a six strand billet caster tundish whose one side is curved. The results obtained were compared with a conventional delta shaped tundish and the strong role of curvature in modifying the fluid flow characteristics is noticed. Investigations were performed to study the effect of ladle pouring point in a curved shape tundish. It was found that fluid flow characteristics can be improved by placing the ladle pouring point at the right position. Simulations have been performed for two different shapes of pouring chamber to investigate the role of curvature in the flow control devices. The results obtained confirmed the strong role of curvature to get the improved characteristics for inclusion flotation.

During the casting process, the steel cleanliness can be made worse because of the reoxidation of the molten steel in contact with the atmosphere and/or other sources of oxygen (refractories, top slag, etc.). In the industrial trial periods, four tundish refractory linings (preformed boards, two kinds of gunning materials and dry vibrating material, all MgO based refractories) were used in order to evaluate the interactions between the refractories and the molten steel. Owing to the small dimension of the tundish (5 ton) used in the continuous casting at Villares Metals SA, after casting, the chilled steel was cut in order to show, in a single section, the stopper, submerged entry nozzle, MgO ramming and the working refractory lining. Cross-sections of samples from the steel/refractory interface were investigated by electron probe microanalysis (EPMA). Four major aspects were observed at the steel/refractory interface: steel infiltration into the tundish refractory lining, mainly in the gunning materials; a steel oxidised layer formed at the steel/refractory lining interface; formation of a spinel layer between steel and tundish working refractory lining; and many particles were found in the steel phase, near to the steel/refractory interface, being a potential source of non-metallic inclusions.

Abstract: Recently, high grade quality has been demanded for strips and surface-treated steel plates. Since non-metallic inclusions are the main cause of steel plate defects, the reduction of inclusion quantity is a very important problem for steelmaking. In particular, the cleanliness of molten steel in a tundish plays a crucial part in improving the quality of steel plate as well as in preventing immersion nozzle clogging. The tundish includes the functions of flotation and removal of inclusions, though, some contamination to the molten steel also occurs in the tundish. Therefore, it is necessary to make clear the cause of each pollutant and its level in order to produce super clean steels.In this study, the contamination causes of molten steel in the tundish and their influences were analyzed by continual metal sampling during operation with respect to the size, number and composition of the inclusions.The results are as follows:(1) Air oxidation of molten steel is the biggest factor of contamination.(2) The influence of air oxidation decreases and the pollutions of slag increases during continuous operations.

Existing technologies have been improved and new technologies are being introduced all along the process route to minimise the size and quantity of inclusions. In continuous casting, the function of tundish has changed from its early role as a liquid steel buffer to a multifunctional vessel, dominating quality adjustments, specifically inclusion flotation. To meet stringent cleanliness requirements, a methodology of forced flotation of inclusions by controlled bubbling of inert gas in tundish was developed and investigated. Location of the bubbling arrangement was optimised using the flow profile generated by water modelling experiments. Optimum gas flowrates were calculated mathematically and further adjusted with a series of experiments. Extensive plant scale trials were used to optimise the process parameters and bring the technology to practice. There was a 33 70% reduction in inclusions of size greater than 50 m and a 13 36% reduction in inclusions 25 50 m. Inclusion removal reduced at higher casting speeds. Under steady state conditions, efficiency of inclusion flotation was found to be a function of casting speed. Additionally, a significant reduction in oxide build-up and nozzle clogging was observed thus lengthening refractory life. Authors: D. Satish Kumar, T.

Increasing the bubbly volume fraction in the tundish and the tundish residence time can be used to improve the inclusion removal efficiency by gas bubbling. However, the formation of small bubbles in a tundish may be problematic as bubble size is affected by the high wetting angles typical of liquid metal contact with bubble orifice materials.On a analys la probabilit de l enl vement d inclusions de l acier liquide par collision et attachement des bulles ascendantes de gaz.

Effects of the binary basicity (CaO/SiO2), TiO2, Na2O, Li2O, MgO, MnO and B2O3 on the melting temperature, viscosity and heat flux of F-free mold powders are investigated. The laboratory results indicate that 1) the melting temperature and the viscosity of the F-free powder decrease, as expected, with increasing the content of Li2O, B2O3 and Na2O respectively, but the lowest viscosity is achieved with 6.0 mass% TiO2; 2) the heat flux of the F-free slag film with 1.0 6.0 mass% TiO2 is close to that of a conventional mold slag film with 2.0 10.0 mass% F; 3) the effect of basicity of the F-free powder on the heat flux is the same as the powder bearing fluoride; 4) the heat flux changes significantly with more than 8.0 mass% Na2O and about 4.0 mass% MnO, whereas the effects of Li2O and B2O3 in the F-free powder on heat flux are not significant.

Film sampling was carried out in the tail-out phase at the end of the cast. The films were subjected to chemical analyses and respective compounds and phases were distinguished. Local heat fluxes were measured with thermocouples and the resulting data was subjected to analyses. n nNo previous study utilising equivalent sampling and analysis has been reported. Several massive samples were collected, a number of which were several millimetres in thickness and covered virtually the entire width of the mould, descending 40cm below the meniscus. Analysis showed that the flux films could explain some of the very low, local heat fluxes that were observed. n nThe most typical feature in the sampled films was the layer dominated by a cuspidine phase. The crystalline structure of these films had either formed during solidification, or via the devitrification process. Following a high cooling rate and short residence time prior to sampling, glassy structures were found. Most of these findings accord well with the literature. Such crystalline structures are to be expected in these conditions, via either direct formation or devitrification. Evidence from the literature confirms that the layers in the films were formed during the longer period of the casting process and not during tail-out. n nThe most unexpected feature was the formation of a separate NaF layer, and the formation of elemental sodium , and probably sometimes potassium (K), against the mould wall. The study found that the films can have residence times of as much as several hours on the mould wall, and complex structures containing several sub layers, voids and pores can develop. With the aid of temperature recordings, evidence of fracturing was found in the sampled films. Variation was seen in the appearance of surfaces on the mould side. There were variations between samples from different heats, and local variations in centimetre scale. n nThis method can be used when evaluating the functioning of different casting powders.

The main registered mass losses were associated with carbon oxidation and thermal decomposition of carbonates presented in investigated powders. Based on the DTA results, melting temperature, as well as other endo/exothermal effects of reactions taking place in the system, was elaborated. The possibility of FactSage usage, to elucidate the influence of selected components on the viscosity of investigated casting powders, is also presented. On the basis of the conducted research, it was found that recorded mass disturbance was not associated with the evaporation of components affecting the viscosity of casting powder.

Finer powders (average mean diameter of 250 300 nm) than have generally been reported for tape casting were used in this study. The optimum formulation for tape casting is affected substantially by decreasing particle size. For example, the amount of dispersant needed is increased. Moreover, the amount of plasticizer/binder must be increased so as to maintain the solids content in the dried tapes below a critical level (about 55 vol% in this case), which decreases with particle size. Rheological studies on the effectiveness of menhaden fish oil and phosphate ester as dispersants show that phosphate ester can be used in lower concentrations, for the preparation of higher solids loading slurries, and was therefore selected for further study. The amount of dispersant required to obtain minimum slurry viscosity was found to be primarily dependent upon the effective particle surface area, defined as that available to the dispersant molecules. In the case of particles composed of agglomerated crystallites (such as the ZrO 2 , powder used here), this may be considerably less than that measured by nitrogen absorption. Moreover, the porous internal structure of such powders is filled with solvent, which increases the effective solids loading of the slurry, and thus its viscosity. Particle morphology also influences the packing efficiency; i.e., the green density decreases as ZrO 2 , is added. Authors: Kevin P. Plucknett, C.H. C ceres, David S.

So values of the viscosity, break temperature and fraction crystalline phase are determined by the mould dimensions, casting conditions and steel grade. Consequently, much of these data were produced in New powder versus Conventional powder and tend to have similar property values. However, some systematic studies have been carried out but there are no published values of the density, surface tension and thermal conductivity.The use of non- Newtonian slags provides a new method of improving steel cleanliness and many of the casting problems encountered in the casting of high Al steels have been reduced using calcium aluminate based slags; however, some further developments are still needed in both cases.

In order to decrease the heat flux in the mold, a mold powder with high crystallization temperature has been ordinarily used. To make clear the mechanism of lowering heat flux in the mold using the mold powder, laboratory experiments were conducted. Thermal resistance was measured using a dipping test of copper mold, which had several thermocouples on the surface. Interfacial thermal resistance was about 2-3 times of thermal resistance of film. To clarify the change of the surface texture by crystallization, the surface of powder plate was observed with a laser microscope. The surface started to wave, when the glass changed to crystal above 830K.

This is achieved via a unique linear melting strategy coupled with a specific selection of process parameters in EB-PBF.

A high LON resulted in a large equiaxed grain zone with a random texture, whereas a fixed LON with a high areal energy density led to a strong texture. The main driving force in the formation of cracks and shrinkage defects during the transition was investigated. A high LON at a fixed areal energy density reduced the average total shrinkage defects and crack length.

Abstract: Heat transfer from solidifying shell to mold near the meniscus plays an important role for the formation of surface cracks on continuously cast steel products. The heat transfer is influenced substantially by the thermal resistance at the interface between mold flux film and copper mold. Accordingly, a model system consisting of steel shell/mold flux film/copper mold is built to simulate the heat transfer near the meniscus in the mold for continuous casting, and the thermal resistance is determined by measuring temperature gradient in the copper mold in the simulator. The interfacial thermal resistance increases with increasing flux film thickness in contrast to previous observation by others who assumed that the interfacial thermal resistance is constant for different flux film thickness. The interfacial thermal resistance is found to be about 50% of overall thermal resistance for the heat transfer. Mold fluxes for medium carbon steel with higher crystallization temperatures show lower heat flux than those for low carbon steel not due to reduced radiative heat transfer but due to higher interfacial thermal resistance at the same flux film thickness.

It has been found that, in mold fluxes for medium carbon steel, the reflectivity of the crystalline slag layer formed in mold flux film is an efficient factor for further reducing the total heat flux in the film. The heat transfer reduction based on this finding would be possible according to the following mechanism: Crystallization of mold flux film increases the reflectivity of the crystalline slag layer in the film owing to enhanced scattering of light by introduction of crystal grain boundaries, and thereby more radiation energy returns from the crystalline slag layer to the steel, leading to reduction in the total heat flux across the film.

However, AHSS often require the addition of large amounts of alloying elements such as aluminum and this can make it difficult to cast sound slabs without surface defects. When casting high aluminum AHSS, due to the reaction between aluminum in steel and silica in mold flux, the viscosity and crystallization characteristics of the mold slag changes drastically, and deteriorates mold lubrication. Therefore, it is critical to limit the reaction between Al in steel and mold slag and at the same time to provide consistent and adequate mold slag in-use properties. This paper describes the development of non-traditional lime-alumina based mold fluxes which have the potential to reduce slag-steel interaction during casting of high aluminum TRIP steel. Several trial casts of 1.45% Al TRIP steel have been conducted on a pilot caster to examine the performance of mold fluxes developed. When the lime-alumina based mold fluxes were applied successfully, alumina pickup was reduced to less than 5% as compared to 15% alumina pickup for corollary trial casts using conventional lime-silica mold fluxes. The developed lime-alumna mold fluxes showed improved in-mold performance as indicated by enhanced lubrication and stable mold heat transfer, again compared to lime-silica fluxes. Cast slabs from the trials using these lime-alumina fluxes have periodic and sound oscillation marks and minimized defects.

An interfacial thermal resistance corresponding to the air gap of 20-50 m is observed in the case of solid mold flux. When the temperature of the mold surface exceeds solidification temperature of the flux, the interfacial thermal resistance disappears together with disappearance of air gaps. The crystallization of the mold flux inhibits the radiative heat transfer that is equivalent to 20% in the total heat flux.

Abstract: Heat transfer in continuous casting mold is important to decide the surface quality of the cast slab of middle carbon steel. Many researchers have recently studied the mechanism of reducing the heat transfer between the mold and the solidified shell, and some of them have pointed out that the interfacial thermal resistance between the mold and surface of solidified mold flux has caused decreasing heat transfer. In the present study, the surface roughness of solidified mold fluxes used for low carbon and middle carbon steel casting, Na2O-CaO-SiO2 and Li2O-CaO-SiO2 slag systems, was measured by a confocal scanning laser microscope combined with an infrared image furnace. It was found that the surface roughness was in the range of approximately 10-30 m when the crystalline phase precipitated. Furthermore, the faster the cooling rate, the smoother the surface roughness of the solidified mold flux became. In the contrast, the surface roughness of the slag, of which critical cooling rate is faster, increased. The surface roughness of the mold flux for middle carbon steel casting became rougher than that for low carbon steel casting. As a result, the surface roughness was related to normalized cooling rate, which is the ratio of actual experimental cooling rate to critical cooling rate. The experimental data of surface roughness were fairly in agreement with calculated values on the assumption of one dimensional heat transfer in the continuous casting mold. Authors: K.

Abstract: Analysis of heat transfer near the meniscus in mold for continuous casting of steel has been carried out by taking into account conductive and radiative thermal resistances of infiltrated mold flux film and thermal resistance at the copper mold/solidifying mold flux film interface. Mold fluxes in commercial use for casting low and medium carbon steel are selected for this study. Thermal conductivities, absorption coefficients and interfacial thermal resistances of these fluxes have been determined in our previous work by laser flash method, high temperature cell FTIR test and contacting thermal resistance test, respectively. Calculation with these data shows that the heat transfer is strongly influenced by the interfacial thermal resistance. Slow cooling required for casting surface crack sensitive medium carbon peritectic steel slabs can be achieved by making the interfacial thermal resistance high, which is attainable by use of basic mold fluxes with high rate of crystallization. A flux film thicker than 0.25 mm for the low carbon steel or 0.4 mm for the medium carbon steel is also found to be a requisite to prevent the occurrence of longitudinal surface cracks. Reasonably high interfacial thermal resistance and a proper flux film thickness are essential to reduce the surface defects and to increase the speed of continuous casting of these steel slabs.

Such experimental data as local heat flux, thickness of solidified shell or mold flux film, and dendrite primary arm spacing were obtained. On the basis of these experimental results, influence of mold flux on initial solidification in the mold was discussed. With mild cooling by crystallization of mold flux, local heat flux and solidification rate decreased in the mold. The changes in them quantitatively correspond to each other. Dendrite primary arm spacing increased with the mild cooling. Relationship between the arm spacing and cooling rate was established and cooling rate on quite initial stage of solidification was stimated. Cooling rate at 1 mm thickness of solidified shell was estimated as about 10000 17000 K/min and changed by mold flux. Unevenness of the solidified shell thickness becomes remarkable when the shell grows to be 1 mm thick. Relation between the unevenness and the cooling rate was discussed, and critical cooling rate against the uneven solidification was observed around 17000 K/min. Thermal resistance of mold flux film was also evaluated and it was clarified that thermal resistance in the film is larger than that by air gap, and Crystallization in the film contributes to increase of both resistances. It is also considered that increase of casting speed makes air gap thinner, so reduction of radiation by crystallization of mold flux becomes more important in high speed continuous casting.

Abstract: Absorption coefficient and extinction coefficient for various commercial mold fluxes have been determined to quantify the radiative and the total heat transfer through the flux film in continuous casting mold. The absorption coefficient is found to be less than 1000 m-1 for glassy specimens whereas the extinction coefficient is ca. 3000-30000 m-1 for crystalline ones. Comparison of observed with calculated radiative heat flux from the absorption coefficient has shown that gray gas approximation is valid for evaluating the radiative heat flux across the mold flux film. Numerical calculation for both radiative and conductive heat transfer has been carried out for a given total thickness of the flux film. Despite little difference in optical properties among various mold fluxes, the radiative heat flux through molten layer of the flux films for low carbon and ultra low carbon steel is found larger than that for medium carbon steel. This is due to increasing thickness ratio of molten layer to crystalline layer of flux films. Solidifying and crystallizing behavior of mold fluxes is a key factor to control the radiative heat transfer in continuous casting mold, accordingly.

Solidification temperatures of the mold flux were measured at various compositions, and crystal compositions in their solidified structure were identified by X-ray diffraction analysis. Based on these results, the phase relation between the mold flux composition and cupsidine was considered. In the relation between basicity (T.CaO/SiO2) and the solidification temperature, there was a peak of the solidification temperature and the basicity at the peak varied according to the contents of Na2O and F.

On the other hand, the composition of the mold flux, that enabled the high speed casting of hypoperitectic steel slabs at 5.0m/min without longitudinal surface cracking, was estimated to be in the field and close to be cuspidine.

Abstract: The effect of SiO2 addition on the decomposition of Na2CO3 was investigated using the thermo-gravimetric and differential scanning calorimetric method (TG-DSC). Addition of SiO2 greatly enhanced the decomposition of Na2CO3. The main decomposition reaction began to take place at a eutectic temperature of the Na2O-SiO2 system (800 degreesC). The initial decomposition product was identified as Na2SiO3, irrespective of the mixing ratio of Na2CO3 to SiO2. The governing reaction of the decomposition was concluded to be Na2CO3 SiO2 Na2SiO3(s) CO2(g). The decomposition rate was independent of the Na2CO3/SiO2 mixing ratio until either one has completely been exhausted and hence was not available any more for the above reaction. If surplus Na2CO3 exists after formation of Na2SiO3 by reacting with all SiO2, the remaining Na2CO3 decomposes partly by reacting with Na2SiO3 to form Na6Si2O7 and partly by thermal self-decomposition. A liquid layer that was formed at the carbonate/additive interface facilitated the decomposition of the carbonates. The melting behavior of a mold flux was greatly influenced by the lowest eutectic temperature that a mold flux system can exhibit. The apparent activation energy of the decomposition of Na2CO3 in existence with SiO2 was estimated to be 426 kJ (.) mol(-1).

Furthermore, Raman spectroscopy analysis is used to appreciate the structure of molten mold flux and shear thinning. Mold fluxes tested reveal definite shear thinning characteristic of decreasing viscosity with increasing shear rate. The degree of shear thinning has been well quantified by Oswald De Waele power law model. Lastly, the degree of polymerization, obtained from Raman spectroscopic data has proportional relationship with degree of shear thinning in the range of 1 5 s 1 shear rate.

For mild-cooling of solidified shell, the mold flux was designed to crystallize effectively by new method which gives accurate phase relation between mold flux composition and cuspidine (3CaO 2SiO2 CaF2).The results were as follows;(1) It was possible to increase casting speed to 5.0 m/min without surface longitudinal cracking on slabs by the developed mold flux of mild-cooling.(2) The stability of phase equilibrium between mold flux composition and cuspidine was important to promote crystallization in flux film between mold and solidified shell. Then interaction between F- and Na was necessary to be considered for accurate prediction about phase relation between them.(3) Because of crystallization in flux film, the top of solidified shell was cooled mildly to be uniform and that resulted in prevention of surface longitudinal crack of slabs.

Therefore, in this paper, the viscosity and crystallization behaviors of conventional F-containing commercial mold flux and newly designed F-free mold fluxes were investigated by using rotating cylinder method and Single/Double Hot Thermocouple Technique (SHTT/DHTT). Results shows that the viscosities of designed F-free mold fluxes are close to the F-containing mold flux; and the crystallization temperatures of F-free mold fluxes increases with the increase of basicity and Na2O/Li2O content; while it decreases with the increase of cooling rate and the addition of B2O3. The final steady state structure of F-free mold fluxes during the DHTT tests shows it is composed of a major crystalline and a thin liquid layer (5.42 7.2%) without glass phase. The results of XRD indicate that the main crystalline phases formed in designed F-free mold fluxes were calcium borosilicate (Ca11Si4B2O22) and calcium magnesium silicate (Ca14Mg2(SiO4)8. Through the comprehensive comparison, the designed F-free mold fluxes flux Sample E (Basicity 1.15, Na2O 7.92, Li2O 1.97 and B2O3 5.98) has the closest performances to the benchmark conventional mold flux Sample A.

Crystallization temperature, CCT curve and crystallization rate were evaluated from the observed images. The evaluated results were compared between two kinds of mold flux, and influence of basicity on crystallization rate was discussed. Crystallization temperature increased with basicity. Crystallization rate also increased with basicity, but its dependency on cooling rate was differed by basicity. The difference could be explained by the viscosity of mold flux at crystallization temperature. Crystallization rate has clear relation to the viscosity at crystallization temperature, and the rate increased with decrease of the viscosity. Two kinds of mold flux were unified in this relationship. Crystallization is controlled with basicity in terms of not only equilibrium but also kinetics through viscosity.

In this paper, the melting and heat transfer behaviors have been studied by using Single Hot Thermocouple Technique (SHTT) and Infrared Emitter Technique (IET). The results show that the melting temperature range of F-free mold flux decreases with the addition of Na2O/Li2O and B2O3 contents; and the heat flux decreases with the increase of basicity and Na2O/Li2O, as well as the decrease of B2O3 contents.

By using an infrared radiation emitter, a radiative heat flux was applied to a copper mold covered with solid mold flux disk to simulate the heat transfer phenomena in continuous casting. The effective thermal conductivities were determined by measuring the temperature gradient in the copper mold system. It was found that the solid crystalline mold Flux2 for casting medium carbon steel has a better capability to transfer heat than that of solid crystalline Flux1, while their glassy fluxes behave similar capability. The DHTT (Double Hot Thermocouple Technique) was employed in this paper to study the heat transfer capability of the crystalline mold fluxes. DHTT measurements suggested that the thermal diffusivity of crystalline sample of Flux2 is higher than that of Flux1. The XRD and SEM results were indicated that the precipitated crystalline phase for Flux1 is only granular cuspidine, Ca4Si2O7F2, while those for Flux2 are consisted of dendritic cuspidine, Ca4Si2O7F2 and gehlenite, Ca2Al2SiO7.

Intensive efforts have been made to optimize properties, and hereby, several types of mold fluxes, including mold fluxes with high basicity and high glassy property (dual high mold fluxes), mold fluxes with strong oxidizing components to protect SiO 2 from reduction, mold fluxes with high SiO 2 content to decrease the viscosity and basicity, mold fluxes with low SiO 2 content for the purpose of attenuated reactivity, and molten mold fluxes to increase consumption, have been developed. Significant efforts have been made to study the theoretical basis and practical application of these mold fluxes. To summarize, the most potential solution of mold fluxes for high alloy (Al, Mn, Ti) steel continuous casting is to further optimize the nonreactive mold fluxes systematically to achieve a coordinated control of lubrication and heat transfer.

Effects of different B 2 O 3 , TiO 2 content, and basicities on the viscosity characteristics have been examined. Viscosity of fluoride free mold fluxes containing B 2 O 3 and TiO 2 was found to decrease with the increase of B 2 O 3 , TiO 2 content, and basicity. The values of apparent activation energy for viscous flow of slags decrease with additions of B 2 O 3 and TiO 2 and the increase of basicity. Two parameters A and B in Riboud model were re evaluated based on the present experimental data, and the modified Riboud model was used to estimate the viscosity of fluoride free slag system investigated in present work. The viscosity values obtained by the experimental measurement were in good agreement with those calculated by the modified Riboud model.

Consequently, the mold flux performance is deteriorated, impeding the smooth running of the continuous casting and affecting the quality of the cast slab. To solve this problem, thermodynamic calculations and laboratorial crucible experiments were performed to investigate the reduction of different mold fluxes by the aluminum in molten steel. Plant trials based on the laboratory studies were performed. It was found that SiO2, MnO, Na2O and B2O3 reacted with the aluminum in molten steel, while CaO, CaF2, MgO, Li2O and BaO did not. Since the composition contents of in CaO-Al2O3-based mold flux were changed only slightly after steel/slag interfacial reactions, a stable CaO-Al2O3-based mold flux was tested in industry production. The application effect of this stable mold flux was very good. Authors: Ting Wu, Shengping He, Lilong Zhu", "chunk_tokens": 233, "total_tokens": 233, "is_full_text": true}

It is shown that the diffusion of atoms, the Ostwald ripening effect, and Brownian movement together control the growth of small size particles. It appears that this stage of initial precipitation lasts for only about 10 s. When the particle diameter exceeds a threshold of ~1 μm, the growth process becomes dominated by particle collisions and agglomeration. The efficiency of these mechanisms depends on the particle size distribution as produced during growth. Comprehensive evaluations are still impeded by the limited capacity of computers at present.", "source": "https://openalex.org/W2040247144", "pdf_url": null, "year": 2003, "country": "USA", "authors": ["Lifeng Zhang", "Wolfgang Pluschkell"], "query": "steel deoxidation"}

In order to account for the turbulent circulating flow induced by gas bubbling through the bottom, the kappa-epsilon turbulence model was employed to evaluate time-averaged Reynolds stress while the fluctuation of the free surface of the melt was traced by means of the VOF technique. This model enables to couple transient flow fields, and temperature fields with concentration fields of elements and inclusions in melt so that it can meet the requirements of evolution of time- and space-dependent particle size distributions (PSD) without any given initial PSID of inclusions but directly from chemical reaction. The model was applied to the simulation of the molten steel deoxidation process in Fe-Al-O system in an argon gas-stirred ladle. The model successfully predicted important phenomena including turbulent recirculation flow patterns, streamline structure of steel melt, turbulence energy variation and its dissipation rate, transient temperature fields and particle size distributions of alumina inclusion. Comparison with some industrial data showed that the predicted PSDs were reasonable in time-dependent variation of inclusion size distribution.", "source": "https://openalex.org/W2066658181", "pdf_url": "https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/isijinternational/48/7/48_7_891/_pdf", "year": 2008, "country": "KR", "authors": ["Youjong Kwon", "Jian Zhang", "Hae-Geon Lee"], "query": "steel deoxidation"}

{"title": "Deoxidation Mechanism of Al-Killed Steel during Industrial Refining Process", "abstract": "Deoxidation is a key step for steel refining, and it would influence the cleanliness of final product. In present study, the measured and calculated oxygen activities in Al-killed bulk steel were compared according to industrial trails, and the Fe–O equilibrium at the interface between slag and steel was also concerned by thermodynamic analysis. Finally, the deoxidation mechanism of Al-killed during industrial refining was proposed. It is found that the activity of oxygen in bulk steel is controlled by Al content, since the activity of oxygen in bulk steel is very close to the equilibrium value as the activity of Al2O3 is treated as unity. In order to keep low oxygen in molten steel, a certain Al content needs to be guaranteed. At slag-steel interface, the activity of oxygen is controlled by FeO, which is much larger than that of bulk steel, so the oxygen would transfer from slag into bulk steel. Slagging therefore presents its importance for deoxidation to reduce the oxygen transfer. Besides, the essence of SiO2 supplying oxygen is Al consumption in bulk steel, which gives rise to the increase of dissolved oxygen. So, stable refining slag is also very important to obtain low oxygen steel, and the slag basicity needs to be no smaller than 3 to reduce the Al consumption caused by SiO2 reduction. In present study, the basicity of 3–4 is recommended to refine low oxygen Al-killed steel.", "source": "https://openalex.org/W2003640344", "pdf_url": "https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/isijinternational/54/7/54_1498/_pdf", "year": 2014, "country": "USA", "authors": ["Zhiyin Deng", "Miaoyong Zhu"], "query": "steel deoxidation"}

The present work concerns the compositional variation of the inclusions formed in the Mn-Si deoxidation of steel, focused on alumina content in the cooling process from 1848 to 1773 K. In order to take the mass balances of the components involved in a reaction system, a reaction region was introduced which consisted of liquid steel bath and a certain amount of the oxides belonging to added flux and refractory of refining vessels. The compositional variation of the inclusions was estimated on the basis of the deoxidation equilibria and the mass balances. The thermodynamic analysis has revealed that the composition of inclusions has such a temperature dependence as to be considerably influenced by the initial total contents of reactants involved in the deoxidation system. It is suggested that high total contents of aluminum and oxygen in the initial state reduce the temperature dependence and thereby will facilitate the composition control in the cooling process till solidification. In Mn-Si deoxidation, there may be two approaches to control alumina content of inclusions; one is to leave the target composition once attained at an appropriate temperature till solidification intact, and the other is to form inclusions stable on temperature falling through regulating the initial total contents of aluminum and oxygen to adequately high levels.", "source": "https://openalex.org/W2031776101", "pdf_url": "https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/isijinternational1989/39/7/39_7_664/_pdf", "year": 1999, "country": "Japan", "authors": ["Saburo Kobayashi"], "query": "steel deoxidation"}

The present study first optimized the thermodynamic model by supplementing thermodynamic data of the RE-compound to study the formation of various inclusions in the Ce–Si–Al–O system. On this basis, laboratory-scale experiments with different deoxidation conditions were designed to obtain samples containing one single type of inclusions, viz., SiO2, SiO2–Ce2O3 or SiO2–Al2O3–Ce2O3, respectively. Subsequently, the agglomeration behavior of inclusions was observed in situ by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), and the corresponding attractive forces were calculated to compare the agglomeration tendency of various inclusions. The results indicate that, in the Si deoxidized samples, SiO2–Ce2O3 inclusions agglomerate to form clusters with the attractive force of 4.3 × 10−17N to 4.2 × 10−15N, which is weaker than that of Al2O3 and Al2O3–Ce2O3 inclusions after Al deoxidation. Although SiO2 inclusions can agglomerate, their attractive force is only 6.3 × 10−19N to 1.2 × 10−16N, which is the weakest of the above inclusions. In the case of Si/Al complex deoxidization, spherical SiO2–Al2O3–Ce2O3 liquid inclusions are formed after Ce treatment, and no agglomeration of such inclusions was observed in situ.

The pellets composed of MgO and Al are charged into an immersion tube and the magnesium vapor produced in situ by aluminothermic reduction of magnesium oxide is injected directly into molten steel to react with the dissolved sulfur and oxygen in it. Effects of various operating parameters on desulfurization and deoxidation are discussed.In the case of the high initial oxygen concentration, deoxidation of molten steel proceeds preferentially, and desulfurization does not take place. When the oxygen concentration in the melt is low enough, desulfurization of molten steel with magnesium vapor can proceed.A higher initial sulfur concentration increases the desufurization ratio of molten steel. The sulfur concentration in the melt tends to be in equilibrium with the magnesium partial pressure in the Mg–Ar bubble rather than the dissolved magnesium concentration in the melt. Increasing pellet mass promoted desulfurization of molten steel. The maximum desulfurization ratio of molten steel can be obtained at a relatively low argon carrier gas flow rate. In both cases of the porous magnesia and the dense alumina immersion tubes with injecting holes, addition of lime onto the melt surface increases the desulfurization ratio. The desulfurization using the dense alumina tube is accompanied by resulfurization more significantly at the later stage than that using the porous magnesia tube.", "source": "https://openalex.org/W2009384846", "pdf_url": "https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/isijinternational/47/3/47_3_418/_pdf", "year": 2007, "country": "Japan", "authors": ["Jian Yang", "Mamoru Kuwabara", "Takao Sakai", "Naoyuki Uchida", "Zhongzhu Liu"], "query": "steel deoxidation"}

A Confocal Scanning Laser Microscope (CSLM) was used to evaluate the effect of cooling rate by re-melting and quenching during solidification. Fine secondary de-oxidation particles were obtained in the Ti-killed samples, and the particle density increased with increasing oxygen content, and their size decreased with increasing the cooling rate during solidification.The secondary Ti de-oxidation particles were found to have an effect on microstructure evolution, such as solidifying microstructure, austenite grain growth and austenite decomposition. The de-oxidation particles were examined through FE-TEM and were identified to be TiO, MnTiO3 and Mn2TiO4, in low oxygen ([O]=7 ppm) and high oxygen ([O]=56, 81 ppm) Ti-killed steels respectively, which were qualitatively same as those predicted by thermodynamic calculations. Stabilities of TiO, MnTiO3 and Mn2TiO4 are influenced by Mn presence. Composition change and decomposition of oxide were estimated through thermodynamic calculations. The effect of the particles on ferrite formation was evaluated through thermo-mechanical treatments. TiO was the most effective for promoting ferrite formation through heterogeneous nucleation. The particles contributed to ferrite formation in the following order, TiO>TiN>MnS> MnTiO3>Ti2O3.It was found that the secondary Ti de-oxidation particles work are engulfed by the advancing solid phase during solidification based on analysis with PET (Pushing Engulfment Transition) velocity, particle sizes and solidification rates.

{"title": "Effect of Silicon–Manganese Deoxidation on Oxygen Content and Inclusions in Molten Steel", "abstract": "In order to improve the cleanliness of steel, non-aluminum deoxidation processes have begun to replace aluminum deoxidation processes. Although the aluminum deoxidation process can reduce the oxygen content in steel to <10 × 10−6, this deoxidation method causes fatigue failure resulting from the formation of large-grained spherical (Ds-type) inclusions composed of calcium–aluminate. It also tends to lead to nozzle blockage during casting. Given the above problems, this study conducted an in-depth investigation of silicon–manganese deoxidation. Thermal experiments and thermodynamic calculations were used to assess the impact of different Mn–Si ratios on the oxygen content and inclusion characteristics during the deoxidation process of molten steel with different initial oxygen contents. The experimental samples were analyzed using an oxygen–nitrogen–hydrogen analyzer, a direct reading spectrometer, and an automatic scanning electron microscope. After that, the samples were electrolyzed to observe the 2D morphology and 3D morphology of the inclusions using scanning electron microscopy. Finally, thermodynamic calculations were carried out using FactSage to verify the experimental results. The results indicated that, regardless of the initial oxygen content, silicon–manganese deoxidation maintained the total oxygen content at 35 × 10−6. It effectively managed the plasticization of inclusions in molten steel, predominantly yielding spherical silicates while minimizing Al-containing inclusions. Nevertheless, as the initial content of [O] increased, the size and density of the silicate inclusions in the steel also increased. An optimal point in the number and size of inclusions was observed with an increased Mn–Si ratio. Moreover, the combined utilization of silicon–manganese deoxidation, diffusion deoxidation, and vacuum deoxidation enabled ultra-low oxygen content control of molten steel.", "source": "semanticscholar:2caff06c090df8a21458893861127b47b0a373ae", "pdf_url": "https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9717/12/4/767/pdf?version=1712765941", "year": 2024, "country": "Unknown", "authors": ["Tianle Song", "Zhongliang Wang", "Yanping Bao"], "query": "steel deoxidation"}

The model was developed based on the slag–steel equilibrium theory, the law of mass conservation, as well as the ion and molecule coexistence theory. And the model involves the Si–Mn–Cr–Fe–S–O reaction system. By comparing the measured values and the model-predicted values, the model has been proved that can effectively predict the equilibrium oxygen and sulphur contents in 201 SS with CaO–SiO2–MgO–CaF2 slag. The average deviation between the model-predicted value and the measured value is <1.5×10−6. Both the model-predicted values and the measured values show that a high basicity is beneficial for the deoxidation and desulphurisation of steel. Moreover, the measured values of the minimum oxygen and sulphur contents are 8.69×10−6 and 8.10×10−6, respectively, which are obtained at B≥1.9. Increasing the MgO content at B=1.7 to within 5 wt-% slightly improves the deoxidation and desulphurisation of the steel, while it has no effect at (% MgO)≥7.0. Increasing the CaF2 content in the range of 20–40 wt-% slightly decreases the equilibrium sulphur content (3.6×10−6) in the steel, but it does not affect the equilibrium oxygen content. As a result, the optimum slag for both the deoxidation and desulphurisation of 201 SS is to maintain a binary basicity range of 1.9–2.1, with MgO content at saturation state and CaF2 content at 40 wt-%.

{"title": "Simplified ResNet approach for data driven prediction of microstructure-fatigue relationship", "abstract": "The heterogeneous microstructure in metallic components results in locally varying fatigue strength. Metal fatigue strongly depends on size and shape of non-metallic inclusions and pores, commonly referred to as \"defects\". Nodular cast iron (NCI) contains graphite inclusions (nodules) whose shape and frequency influence the fatigue strength. Fatigue strength can be simulated by micromechanical finite element models. The drawback of these models are the large computational costs. Therefore, we employ a data-driven machine learning methodology. More precisely, we utilize the simplified residual neural network (SimResNet) which was recently introduced (Herty et al., Kinetic Theory for Residual Neural Networks, 2020) to predict fatigue strength from metallographic data. For the training, we use fatigue data which is simulated with a micromechanical model and the shakedown theorem. The micromechanical models are derived directly from micrographs of nodular cast iron, respectively. The application of SimResNet shows a good performance to predict fatigue strength by local microstructures of nodular cast iron. We show several test cases. The simplified character of SimResNet enables fast predictions of fatigue by microstructures, even in comparision to classical residual neural networks.", "source": "arxiv:2005.06615v1", "pdf_url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.06615v1.pdf", "year": 2020, "country": "Unknown", "authors": ["Christian Gebhardt", "Torsten Trimborn", "Felix Weber", "Alexander Bezold", "Christoph Broeckmann"], "query": "non-metallic inclusions"}
{"title": "Exploring the wettability of liquid iron on refractory oxides with sessile drop technique and density-functional derived Hamaker constants", "abstract": "The macroscopic interactions of liquid iron and solid oxides, such as alumina, calcia, magnesia, silica, and zirconia manifest the behavior and efficiency of high-temperature metallurgical processes. The oxides serve dual roles, both as components of refractory materials in submerged entry nozzles and also as significant constituents of non-metallic inclusions in the melt. It is therefore crucial to understand the physicochemical interplay between the liquid and the oxides in order to address the nozzle clogging challenges, and thereby optimize cast iron and steel production. This paper presents a methodology for describing these interactions by combining the materials' dielectric responses, computed within the density functional theory, with the Casimir-Lifshitz dispersion forces to generate the Hamaker constants. The approach provides a comprehensive understanding of the wettability of iron against these refractory oxides, revealing the complex relation between molecular and macroscopic properties. Our theoretically determined crystalline structures are confirmed by room-temperature X-ray diffraction, and the contact angles of liquid iron on the oxides are validated with a sessile drop system at the temperature 1823 K. For comparison, we also present the wettability of the oxides by a liquid tin-bismuth alloy.

{"title": "Non-metallic inclusions in steels – origin and control", "abstract": "Non-metallic inclusions (NMIs) play a key role in many important properties of steel, influencing both processing and application of steel products. In this work, the current understanding of the origin and classification of NMIs is reviewed, highlighting the dramatic development of the last decades. This includes the discussion of the thermodynamics of inclusion formation and the current knowledge on the effects of melt shop processing variable on NMIs composition, amount and size distribution. The development of inclusion engineering – tailoring the process to obtain the desired NMIs is highlighted and the development in selected areas – tire cord, springs and bearing steels as well as prevention of nozzle clogging – is used to illustrate this development. The promising field of “oxide metallurgy” is also discussed in the context of inclusion engineering. Finally, the difficulties in meaningfully characterizing and quantifying NMIs are briefly commented. In summary it is concluded that inclusion control in steels has evolved significantly in the last decades. This is due to the progress in understanding the interplay between thermodynamics, steel and slag chemical composition as well as melt shop processing. This made possible the tailoring of non-metallic inclusions via processing, to optimize steel properties.

{"title": "Role of non-metallic inclusions in formation of acicular ferrite in low alloy weld metals", "abstract": "AbstractA critical investigation into the role of non-metallic inclusions in the nucleation of acicular ferrite in low alloy C–Mn–Ni weld metals was carried out using rapid in situ quenching, transmission electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy analysis, and dilatometric techniques. The relationship between the transformed acicular ferrite, the inclusions, and the chemical nature of the inclusions which had actually nucleated ferrite laths was examined in detail. By employing weld metals with either intermediate (200–350 ppm) or low (15–30 ppm) oxygen levels, the inclusion chemistry and nucleation behaviour of acicular ferrite in welds with different oxygen contents were compared. In addition, the influence of the [Al]/[O] ratio in lower oxygen content weld metals was also examined. It was found that the first acicular ferrite laths nucleated from the inclusions at both oxygen levels, and the chemical composition of the active inclusions varied considerably. The inclusions nucleated acicular ferrite by acting simply as inert substrates with the ability to reduce the free energy barrier to nucleation. The number and size distribution of the inclusions appeared to be the dominant factors; the thermal stress-strain fields and lattice disregistry were less important. The most favourable type of inclusions were within the size range 0·3–0·9 μm for the higher oxygen content weld metals and 0·35–0·75 μm for the lower oxygen level weld metals. A high [Al]/[O] ratio depresses the formation of acicular ferrite by increasing the soluble matrix aluminium content, which encourages extensive ferrite sideplate formation; the concurrent variation in inclusion chemical composition did not appear to influence the nucleation of acicular ferrite.MST/3209", "source": "https://openalex.org/W2010823967", "pdf_url": null, "year": 1996, "country": "Unknown", "authors": ["Z.

With reaction time extended from 30 to 180 min, solid MgO–Al2O3 and MgO-based inclusions were finally changed into CaO–MgO–Al2O3 system inclusions lower melting temperature (<1773 K).

The results indicated that MgO and MgO·Al2O3 inclusion would be formed at early stage of steel-slag reaction because activity of Mg is much larger than that of Ca in steel. However, with increase of Ca activity, solid MgO·Al2O3 and MgO inclusions would be inevitably and gradually transferred into complex liquid inclusions even dissolved [Ca] is as low as 0.0002%. Thus, SEM-EDS mappings of CaO–MgO–Al2O3 system inclusions are characterized by high melting temperature solid MgO·Al2O3 or MgO-based inclusion cores surrounded by lower melting temperature CaO–Al2O3 outer surface layers, which would be softer during hot rolling and therefore be helpful to improve anti-fatigue properties of steel.Model was established to elucidate change mechanisms of inclusions.

It is found that during the tapping process, Al–O deoxidization reaction is very close to equilibrium with the formation of many Al2O3 clusters. With the slag/steel reaction, inclusions vary with the route as Al2O3 inclusions→MgO–Al2O3 system inclusions→CaO–MgO–Al2O3 system inclusions, and finally change into globular inclusions surrounded by CaO–Al2O3 outer layer, of which the melting point is lower than liquid steel temperature. Since MgO is less stable than CaO and it is easier to be reduced by Al, dissolved Mg is generated earlier and faster than Ca before LF refining, thus the MgO–Al2O3 system inclusions form at first. The mapping photos of inclusions show that the evolution mechanism of MgO–Al2O3 system inclusions into CaO–MgO–Al2O3 system inclusions is Ca element substitution for Mg element in MgO–Al2O3 inclusions.

To investigate the distribution, morphology, and chemical composition, along with the change in such characteristics, during the hot deformation of non-metallic inclusions, thermo-mechanical treatment with a compression test was carried out. Moreover, the reduction of area with the tensile test species, which refers to the local ductility of steel, was examined, and the effect of the distribution, morphology, and chemical compositions of both the Al2O3 inclusions and the elongated MnS inclusions were studied.Consequently, metal sulfur content of higher than 60 ppm and elongated MnS inclusions of over 10 regarding the aspect ratio were observed. In addition, the elongated MnS inclusions had a stronger influence on local ductility than the smaller Al2O3 inclusions, and drastic effects on the nucleation of voids. Thus, a fracture is most likely to be initiated by void formation at the interface of the elongated MnS inclusions and metal matrix notched by MnS, and thus would experience coalescence in accordance with a brittle fracture in the soft MnS inclusions. The local ductility in steel including elongated MnS inclusions is small because the fracturing and deformation of metal are most likely to be related to the elongated MnS inclusions.", "source": "https://openalex.org/W2083981520", "pdf_url": "https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/isijinternational/51/12/51_12_1987/_pdf", "year": 2011, "country": "Japan", "authors": ["Kenichi Yamamoto", "Hideaki Yamamura", "Yoshihiro Suwa"], "query": "non-metallic inclusions"}

Steel samples were taken at various stages of the process and from ladles of different ages. Inclusion numbers were counted under an optical microscope. It was found that the total number of inclusions increased with the ladle age before deoxidation and at the end of the ladle treatment. The increase was substantial after the ladle had been used more than 18 times. Inclusions having the smallest sizes were found to make a large contribution to this increase. This observation was further confirmed by the difference between total oxygen content and dissolved oxygen content in the steel samples, which also showed an increase with ladle age. Analysis by SEM–EDX revealed two types of inclusions before casting, namely, inclusions consisting only of an oxide solution having a composition very close to 3CaO. Al2O3, and inclusions consisting of the same oxide solution as well as MgO phase. This finding was in accordance with the reported result that both 3CaO.

The influence of reheating temperature, in the range 1000–1250°C, and finish rolling temperature (starting cooling temperature), in the range 800–1000°C, was also studied. Interrupted accelerated cooling caused a double enhancement of grain refinement and an increase of precipitation strengthening resulting in increases of yield strength up to 750 MN m−2 and elongations greater than 25%. Increasing the reheating temperature to 1100 and 1250°C for V and Ti steels, respectively, enhanced the increment of precipitation strengthening due to accelerated cooling, but had no effect on grain refinement. Interrupted accelerated cooling was found to be most effective for improving yield strength when it is started at higher temperatures in the γ region. Accelerated cooling effectively inhibited bainite formation and produced very fine grain size at high finish rolling temperatures. This technique is therefore very attractive for processing of microalloyed steels because of the possibility of attaining very fine grains without decreasing the finish rolling temperature, thus reducing the process time.MST/1180", "source": "https://openalex.org/W2058004306", "pdf_url": null, "year": 1991, "country": "Unknown", "authors": ["Mohamed F.

The final compression temperature strongly influenced the order of SIP and SRX and thus the evolution of the austenite structure. Precipitation-time-temperature (PTT) curve obtained for the experimental steel exhibited an inverted “S” shape. A recrystallisation kinetics model revealed that SRX, which occurs preferentially above 940 °C, resulted in delayed subsequent SIP, thus causing deviation in the PTT curve from the typical ‘C’ shape. Below 940 °C, the fastest nose temperature for precipitation was located at 900 °C, and the precipitate was constituted by TiC particles with a NaCl-type FCC structure. The dynamic competition between SIP and SRX processes were evaluated by comparing the relative magnitude of the recrystallisation driving force and precipitation pinning force during stress relaxation, combined with the evolution of precipitate and austenitic structure. The results indicated that the plateau period occurred because of the precipitation pinning effect inhibited recrystallisation-induced austenite softening.

{"title": "Hydrogen-Induced Cracking in GMA Welds of Vanadium–Titanium Microalloyed High Strength Steel", "abstract": "Abstract High strength low alloy (HSLA) steels are developed to provide better strength, toughness, and improved weldability. These steels are often used as better alternatives for quenched and tempered steels due to the excellent combination of these properties. The beneficial properties in these steels are achieved by careful control of composition and by adopting suitably controlled thermomechanical processing (TMCP). Improved weldability is achieved by maintaining carbon at lower level. To compensate the effect of carbon, small amounts of alloying elements, such as niobium, vanadium, titanium, aluminium, and nitrogen are added. Though these steels have good weldability, they suffer from hydrogen induced cracking especially at high strength levels. In the present study, hydrogen induced cracking susceptibility of a newly developed indigenous vanadium–titanium microalloyed high strength steel was evaluated by means of implant cracking test. Welding was carried out using the GMAW process at different heat input levels. It was found that the coarse-grained heat affected zone (CGHAZ) of the steel is prone for hydrogen induced cracking at lower heat inputs. The implant test results indicated that the critical stress level increases with increasing heat inputs. The results were correlated with the microstructural modifications that occur in the CGHAZ at different welding conditions. The microhardness variations in that region were in good agreement with the observed results.

The static recrystallization fractions were calculated by the stress offset method and static recrystallization diagrams for the tested steels were obtained. The effects of deformation temperature and interval time on the softening behaviors were analyzed. Especially, the effect of nitrogen on the softening behaviors of the tested steels is discussed in detail. The results showed that the softening behaviors of the tested steels with various nitrogen contents are different. As far as the steel with low nitrogen content is concerned, the softening fraction increases monotonically with increasing time interval, and higher temperature can promote the static recrystallization. However, with more nitrogen added into vanadium–titanium microalloyed steel, precipitated particles of vanadium titanium carbonitride can be observed in the tested steel at the temperature of 850 °C or 800 °C, which leads to the formation of plateaus on the softening curves. An increase in nitrogen content in the steel is favorable for vanadium titanium carbonitride precipitation, which leads to a stronger prohibition of static recrystallization and a longer plateau on the softening curves. Moreover, the precipitated particles in the tested steel will not play an inhibition role in static recrystallization until the nitrogen content in the steel reaches a critical value.", "source": "https://openalex.org/W4398242253", "pdf_url": null, "year": 2024, "country": "China", "authors": ["Baochun Zhao", "Tan Zhao", "Lei Huang", "Junbo Li"], "query": "titanium microalloying"}

A comprehensive analysis of the microstructure of the transition layer was conducted using material characterization methods, including scanning electron microscope equipped with an energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer. The mechanical performance of the welded joints was assessed using tensile testing. The results indicate that the effective welding width and joint penetration depth at the joint interface were reduced in Ti/Al dissimilar metals when Nb was added as an intermediate layer, under the same welding process parameters, when compared to unalloyed weld seams. Furthermore, the utilization of a 0.05 mm Nb foil as the intermediate layer results in a significant 25% increase in the average shear strength compared to the other condition, with the average shear strength of the joint reaching its peak value at 192 N/mm. The unalloyed Ti/Al weld joint usually fractured along the melting zone, displaying complete brittle fracture characteristics. After Nb microalloying, the joint typically fractures along the transition zone and interface, exhibiting both cleavage and ductile fracture characteristics, indicating the combination of a brittle and toughness fracture. This study provides experimental evidence and new insights for welding Ti/Al composite structures, with significant theoretical and practical applications.", "source": "semanticscholar:df7bf24b58d46e72d5943ba25819a41bb6b3c366", "pdf_url": "https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4701/13/7/1257/pdf?version=1689148375", "year": 2023, "country": "Unknown", "authors": ["Hao Pan", "Yue Wang", "S.

Although the strengthening mechanisms and microalloying effects of Nb, V, and Ti in low‐carbon steels have been extensively studied, those in high‐carbon steels are underresearched. This knowledge gap primarily arises from the substantial effect of high carbon content on phase transformations, precipitation behavior, and the thermodynamic solubility of microalloying elements. To advance the application of microalloying in high‐carbon steels, this review systematically summarizes recent progress in the utilization of Nb, V, and Ti in high‐carbon steels. The primary strengthening mechanisms, including grain refinement strengthening and precipitation strengthening, are thoroughly discussed for each microalloying element, along with their respective effects on mechanical properties. Furthermore, the solubilities of these elements in high‐carbon and low‐carbon steels are compared, emphasizing the challenges in accurately predicting solubility limits. Additionally, the impacts of microalloying elements on the critical properties of steel, such as wear resistance and corrosion behavior, are also reviewed. Finally, key challenges and future research directions are identified to guide further advancements in the field.", "source": "semanticscholar:b42a9529d51c37447a64a7a8c8ba25f3d0bd321d", "pdf_url": "", "year": 2025, "country": "Unknown", "authors": ["Qi Zhang", "Jun Wang", "Mingxing Zhou"], "query": "titanium microalloying"}

{"title": "Reservoir computing based predictive reduced order model for steel grade intermixing in an industrial continuous casting tundish", "abstract": "Continuous casting is a widely adopted process in the steel industry, where maintaining high steel quality is paramount. Efficient prediction of grade intermixing during ladle changeover operations is critical for maintaining steel quality and minimizing material losses in the continuous casting process. Among various factors influencing grade intermixing, operating parameters play a significant role, in addition to tundish geometry and flow control devices. In this study, three-dimensional, transient, two-phase turbulent flow simulations are conducted to investigate the ladle changeover operation. During this process, the molten steel level in the tundish typically varies over time, significantly affecting the grade intermixing phenomena. The influence of ladle change time on intermixing time has been presented. However, high-fidelity full-order simulations of such complex transient phenomena are computationally expensive and are impractical for real-time monitoring or design-space exploration in industrial-scale applications. To address this issue, a reduced order modelling approach based on proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) and reservoir computing (RC) is employed to efficiently predict intermixing time. The proposed reduced order model (ROM) demonstrates excellent predictive accuracy using limited training data while requiring significantly less computational resources and training time.

We also consider the case of having a total heat flux measurement together with the temperature measurements. We develop two methodologies for solving this inverse problem. The first one is the traditional Alifanov's regularization, the second one exploits the parameterization of the heat flux. We develop the latter method to have an offline-online decomposition with a computationally efficient online part to be performed in real-time. In the last part of this work, we test these methods on academic and industrial benchmarks. The results show that the parameterization method outclasses Alifanov's regularization both in performance and computational cost.

This study investigates the fluid flow behaviour in a single-strand tundish using numerical and experimental approaches. Full-order model (FOM) steady-state simulations were conducted under both isothermal and non-isothermal conditions to assess the influence of thermal buoyancy on the flow characteristics. The results show that buoyancy effects under non-isothermal conditions have a negligible impact on the overall velocity field. The converged flow fields serve as initial conditions for transient tracer transport simulations, enabling evaluation of RTD curves and volume partitioning. A Galerkin projection-based reduced-order model (ROM) is developed to efficiently derive RTD curves. Comparison of RTD curves from experiments, FOM simulations, and ROM predictions demonstrates strong agreement, with both computational approaches closely matching experimental data. A parameter-time dependent ROM is subsequently developed using Galerkin projection and operator interpolation. This enables efficient evaluation of RTD curves across varying parameter values with significantly reduced computational cost compared to full-order simulations.

{"title": "Q-learning-based Hierarchical Cooperative Local Search for Steelmaking-continuous Casting Scheduling Problem", "abstract": "The steelmaking continuous casting scheduling problem (SCCSP) is a critical and complex challenge in modern steel production, requiring the coordinated assignment and sequencing of steel charges across multiple production stages. Efficient scheduling not only enhances productivity but also significantly reduces energy consumption. However, both traditional heuristics (e.g., two-stage local search) and recent metaheuristics often struggle to adapt to the dynamic characteristics of practical SCCSP instances. To address these limitations, this paper introduces a novel Q learning based hierarchical cooperative local search framework, termed HierC_Q, aimed at minimizing the weighted sum of the maximum completion time and the average waiting time in SCCSP. The core contributions of HierC_Q are twofold. First, considering the intrinsic coupling properties of the SCCSP, a dedicated reward function is proposed based on a novel coupling measure (CM), guiding the exploration process towards promising regions of the solution space. Second, a hierarchical architecture is devised, comprising two distinct tiers: the learn to improve (L2I) tier and the \"disturb to renovate\" (D2R) tier. The L2I tier performs deep exploitation within promising regions using two independent Q-learning-based local search frameworks (QLSFs) tailored for subproblems, along with a synergy QLSF designed for the main problem. To enhance the effectiveness of local search, a validity evaluation approach and a speed-up evaluation method are also intro-duced, grounded in a detailed study of the problem's structure. Meanwhile, the D2R tier incorporates a perturbation and construction based solution renewal strategy to mitigate the risk of premature convergence. The superiority and effectiveness of HierC_Q are demonstrated through extensive comparisons with eleven local search frameworks and nine state-of-the-art algorithms.", "source": "arxiv:2506.08608v1", "pdf_url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.08608v1.pdf", "year": 2025, "country": "Unknown", "authors": ["Yang Lv", "Rong Hu", "Bin Qian", "Jian-Bo Yang"], "query": "continuous casting"}

These pores are nuclei for ductile damage and need to be closed during rolling in regard of the strict performance requirements of todays advanced high strength steels. Due to the beneficial shape factor of the roll gap, recrystallization and high diffusion rates pore closure and elimination occurs primarily during hot rolling. In this paper, relevant influencing factors on pore closure are investigated based on representative volume elements (RVE). First, the load regime of typical multi-pass hot rolling schedules is calculated via macro scale FEM and then applied to micro scale RVEs. Within the RVE, shape changes of a given pore are tracked and the closure ratio is calculated. This paper elucidates the effect of different roll diameters, absolute reductions per pass, pore shape and pore orientation on the closure rate. The results show that the majority of pores can be closed during the initial hot rolling stages. However, pore closure can be accelerated through suitable process parameters.

While this configuration is relevant to continuous casting processes that are significantly more complex, we focus on the flow patterns associated with the particular form of mixed convection that arises in it. Linear stability analysis and direct numerical simulations (DNS) are conducted, using the spectral element method to identify observable states. The nature of the bifurcations is determined through Stuart--Landau analysis for completeness. The base flow consists of two counter-rotating rolls driven by the baroclinic imbalance due to the curved isothermal boundary. These are however suppressed by the through-flow, which is found to have a stabilising influence as soon as the Reynolds number $Re$ based on the through-flow exceeds 25. For a sufficiently high Rayleigh number, this base flow is linearly unstable to three different modes, depending on $Re$. For $Re\\leq75$, the rolls destabilise through a supercritical bifurcation into a travelling wave. For $100\\leq Re \\leq 110$, a subcritical bifurcation leads to a standing oscillatory mode, whereas for $Re\\geq150$, the unstable mode is non-oscillatory and grows out of a supercritical bifurcation.

{"title": "Suppressing instabilities in mixed baroclinic flow using an actuation based on receptivity", "abstract": "This paper presents a method to stabilise oscillations occurring in a mixed convective flow in a nearly hemispherical cavity, using actuation based on the receptivity map of the unstable mode. This configuration models the continuous casting of metallic alloys, where hot liquid metal is poured at the top of a hot sump with cold walls pulled in a solid phase at the bottom. The model focuses on the underlying fundamental thermo-hydrodynamic processes without dealing with the complexity inherent to the real configuration (Flood &amp; Davidson 1994). This flow exhibits three branches of instability (Kumar &amp; Poth{é}rat 2020). The solution of the adjoint eigenvalue problem for the convective flow equations reveals that the regions of highest receptivity for unstable modes of each branch concentrate near the inflow upper surface. Simulations of the linearised governing equations show that a thermo-mechanical actuation modelled on the adjoint eigenmode asymptotically suppresses the unstable mode. If the actuation's amplitude is kept constant in time, which is easier to implement in an industrial environment, the suppression is still effective but only over a finite time, after which it becomes destabilising. Based on this phenomenology, we apply the same actuation during the stabilising phase only in the nonlinear evolution of the unstable mode. It turns out stabilisation persists, even when the unstable mode is left to evolve freely after the actuation period. These results not only demonstrate the effectiveness of receptivity-informed actuation in stabilising convective oscillations but also suggest a simple strategy for their long-term control.", "source": "arxiv:2312.15121v2", "pdf_url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.15121v2.pdf", "year": 2023, "country": "Unknown", "authors": ["Abhishek Kumar", "Alban Pothérat"], "query": "continuous casting"}

Models to predict hot ductility behaviour have been discussed and the parts of the trough which can be used to predict the likelihood of cracking occurring are highlighted. On tensile testing both deformation induced ferrite in sufficient quantity to improve ductility and dynamic recrystallisation occur but not when straightening during continuous casting; the strain being too low. This limits the use of the hot ductility curve in predicting cracking behaviour. The temperature range in which straightening of the continuously cast strand should be carried out is either 30°C below the Ar 3 when there is a large amount of ferrite (∼40%) present before deformation or above the T d, the temperature at which dynamic recrystallisation starts to take place in a tensile test; this being when the ferrite film no longer forms and precipitates are sufficiently coarse and few in number to influence the ductility. The influence of C,Mn,N, Nb,V,B,Ti,Al and the residuals Cu and Sn on hot ductility are examined and recommendations made with regard to the amounts and cooling conditions required to give freedom from transverse and edge cracks.

These intergranular failures arise as a result of stress and strain concentrations at the austenite boundaries caused either by the presence of thin films of the softer deformation induced ferrite enveloping the austenite grains, or by grain boundary sliding in the austenite. Both failure mechanisms are encouraged by the presence of grain boundary precipitates and inclusions (the finer, the more detrimental), coarser grain sizes, and lower strain rates. The factors which control intergranular failure are analysed, leading to estimates of both the width and depth of the trough. The relation between the hot ductility behaviour in tensile testing and the occurrence of transverse cracking in straightening operations is discussed. It is shown that information from hot ductility tests can be used to predict the likelihood of transverse cracking because the variables that influence the depth of the ductility trough are also responsible for transverse cracking. The steps that can be taken to reduce the incidence of transverse cracking are considered in detail: these include adjustments to the chemical composition, grain size reductions, and control of the volume fraction and size distribution of the inclusions and precipitates. In terms of continuous casting process variables, control of the secondary cooling flow is probably most effective in reducing transverse cracking.", "source": "https://openalex.org/W4248429315", "pdf_url": null, "year": 1991, "country": "Unknown", "authors": ["B.

{"title": "The Physical and Mathematical Modelling of Continuous Casting Tundish System.", "abstract": "Considerable efforts have been made in academia and industry over the last two decades to fully exploit and enhance the metallurgical performance of continuous casting tundish systems. Towards these goals, numerous physical and mathematical modelling studies embodying both industrial and water model tundishes have been carried out and reported in the literature. Based on an extensive literature search, we now present a summary, discussion and analysis of these. For the sake of convenience and clarity of presentation, the studies have been categorised into three major groups: (1) physical modelling (2) mathematical modelling and (3) combined physical and mathematical modelling. In each of these categories, a great number of publications on various aspects of tundish metallurgy, such as, modelling criteria, turbulent fluid flow, residence time distributions (RTD), inclusion transport and separation, heat loss and temperature drop, grade transition and intermixing, etc. have been reported. These works have lead to considerable improvements in our understanding of the various transport processes (viz, RTD, inclusion float out, thermal energy transport, etc.) associated with tundish operations. Comprehensive and sufficiently reliable mathematical models are also currently available and these also allow one to carry out full scale predictions and useful engineering design and process calculations.

The problem is to re-optimize the assignment, sequencing, and timetable of a set of existing and new jobs among various production stages for the new environment when unforeseen changes occur in the production system. We model the problem considering the constraints of the practical technological requirements and the dynamic nature. To solve the SCC scheduling problem, we propose an improved differential evolution (DE) algorithm with a real-coded matrix representation for each individual of the population, a two-step method for generating the initial population, and a new mutation strategy. To further improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the solution process for dynamic use, an incremental mechanism is proposed to generate a new initial population for the DE whenever a real-time event arises, based on the final population in the last DE solution process. Computational experiments on randomly generated instances and the practical production data show that the proposed improved algorithm can obtain better solutions compared to other algorithms.", "source": "https://openalex.org/W2152028815", "pdf_url": null, "year": 2014, "country": "China", "authors": ["Lixin Tang", "Yue Zhao", "Jiyin Liu"], "query": "continuous casting"}

{"title": "Surface Roughness of Solidified Mold Flux in Continuous Casting Process.", "abstract": "Heat transfer in continuous casting mold is important to decide the surface quality of the cast slab of middle carbon steel. Many researchers have recently studied the mechanism of reducing the heat transfer between the mold and the solidified shell, and some of them have pointed out that the interfacial thermal resistance between the mold and surface of solidified mold flux has caused decreasing heat transfer. In the present study, the surface roughness of solidified mold fluxes used for low carbon and middle carbon steel casting, Na2O-CaO-SiO2 and Li2O-CaO-SiO2 slag systems, was measured by a confocal scanning laser microscope combined with an infrared image furnace. It was found that the surface roughness was in the range of approximately 10-30 μm when the crystalline phase precipitated. Furthermore, the faster the cooling rate, the smoother the surface roughness of the solidified mold flux became. In the contrast, the surface roughness of the slag, of which critical cooling rate is faster, increased. The surface roughness of the mold flux for middle carbon steel casting became rougher than that for low carbon steel casting. As a result, the surface roughness was related to normalized cooling rate, which is the ratio of actual experimental cooling rate to critical cooling rate. The experimental data of surface roughness were fairly in agreement with calculated values on the assumption of one dimensional heat transfer in the continuous casting mold.", "source": "https://openalex.org/W2028139679", "pdf_url": "https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/isijinternational1989/39/11/39_11_1150/_pdf", "year": 1999, "country": "Japan", "authors": ["K.

In this paper, the crystallization of an industrial mold slag was quantified using a single hot thermocouple technique which, when combined with a video camera based observation system, allowed observation of the onset and growth of the crystals which were precipitated from the melt. The beginning of crystallization was determined by direct observation and the growth rate of crystals were measured by frame by frame image analysis of recordings of the progress of crystallization. Isothermal experiments were performed at different temperatures and a Time-Temperature-Transformation (TTT) diagram was determined for this industrial mold slag. X-ray diffraction of quenched samples was used to determine the type of crystalline phases that were precipitated. The TTT diagram was divided into two separate regions which corresponded to the precipitation of dicalcium silicate (Ca2SiO4) at temperatures over 1050°C and of Cuspidine (Ca4Si2O7F2) at temperatures below 1050°C. The evolution crystal fraction was described by Avrami's equation. This work indicates that industrial mold slags are easily undercooled, that crystallization occurs throughout the melt, that crystals grow initially as equiaxed dendrites and that the onset of crystallization is a function of cooling rate and must be described by either TTT or CCT curves.", "source": "https://openalex.org/W2040229695", "pdf_url": "https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/isijinternational1989/38/4/38_4_357/_pdf", "year": 1998, "country": "Japan", "authors": ["Yoshiaki Kashiwaya", "Carlos Cicutti", "A.

In addition to the well-known methods of reducing macro-segregation in continuous casting, inline thickness reduction of the partially solidified strand, already used successfully in slab and bloom casting, offers an alternative for producing material with low segregation level.In the present report, which considers the feasibility and effectiveness of a mechanical soft-reduction for the continuous casting of billets, the influence of the soft-reduction position from the metallurgical point of view, the reduction parameter and the roll diameter in combination with the structural design of the soft-reduction unit was assessed comparatively. One strand of the billet caster S4 was modified for this purpose and soft-reduction trials were carried out on high carbon steel grade D72C for wire rod application and spring steel grade 54SiCr6 at casting speeds between 2.80 and 3.60 m/min. The conclusions drawn from the test results with respect to required solid fraction in the liquid core, effective reduction rate and necessary roll diameter formed the basis for designing the soft-reduction unit of billet caster S0 and for predicting favourable process parameters.

{"title": "Continuous Casting of Aluminium", "abstract": "AbstractAbstractThis review covers vertical and horizontal DC casting as well as continuous casting from moving moulds. Attention is first directed to the conventional route by which semifabricated products are produced, the metallurgical features impressed upon them by the method of manufacture, and the ways in which these cali affect important characteristics of the final product. In the DC casting field the trend towards larger scale operation has been paralleled by the development of level pour, 'hot top' techniques to facilitate casting of many strands simultaneously, and, by efforts in this and other ways, to realize the benefits on cast ingot quality of using a short mould, leacting ultimately to the concept of 'mouldless' casting. Meanwhile, there has been a corresponding advance in understanding of the casting process, generated in part by mathematical modelling. Horizontal DC casting is in use for the production of large rolling block and has been demonstrated for the casting of coilable, strip. Recently,.advances have been made in continuous-casting hardware which are likely to increase the range of alloys and product qualities that can be handled by the strip-casting approach. The characteristics of strip-cast metal are reviewed and some thought given to ways in which the weaker features might be improved. Finally, an attempt is made to compare the advantages and disadvantages of strip casting over the conventional route and to indicate the savings in cost, metal, and energy which wider adoption of strip casting could bring", "source": "https://openalex.org/W1994699182", "pdf_url": null, "year": 1976, "country": "Unknown", "authors": ["E.

{"title": "Thermal Resistance at the Interface between Mold Flux Film and Mold for Continuous Casting of Steels.", "abstract": "Heat transfer from solidifying shell to mold near the meniscus plays an important role for the formation of surface cracks on continuously cast steel products. The heat transfer is influenced substantially by the thermal resistance at the interface between mold flux film and copper mold. Accordingly, a model system consisting of steel shell/mold flux film/copper mold is built to simulate the heat transfer near the meniscus in the mold for continuous casting, and the thermal resistance is determined by measuring temperature gradient in the copper mold in the simulator. The interfacial thermal resistance increases with increasing flux film thickness in contrast to previous observation by others who assumed that the interfacial thermal resistance is constant for different flux film thickness. The interfacial thermal resistance is found to be about 50% of overall thermal resistance for the heat transfer. Mold fluxes for medium carbon steel with higher crystallization temperatures show lower heat flux than those for low carbon steel not due to reduced radiative heat transfer but due to higher interfacial thermal resistance at the same flux film thickness. This arises from the difference in crystallizing behavior such as growth rate of crystalline layer between the two fluxes.", "source": "https://openalex.org/W2087608064", "pdf_url": "https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/isijinternational1989/38/5/38_5_440/_pdf", "year": 1998, "country": "Japan", "authors": ["Jung‐Wook Cho", "Hiroyuki Shibata", "Toshihiko Emi", "Mikio Suzuki"], "query": "continuous casting"}

Many product defects are controlled by flow-related phenomena in the mold region, such as slag entrapment due to excessive surface velocity and level fluctuations, meniscus hook defects due to insufficient transport of flow and superheat to the meniscus region, and particle entrapment into the solidification front, which depends on transverse flow across the dendritic interface. Fluid flow also affects heat transfer, solidification, and solute transport, which greatly affect grain structure and internal quality of final steel products. Various electromagnetic systems can affect flow, including static magnetic fields and traveling fields which actively accelerate, slow down, or stir the flow in the mold or strand regions. Optimal electromagnetic effects to control flow depends greatly on the caster geometry and other operating conditions.

The series of Clean Steel conferences, launched in Hungary in 1970 and organized\\n every 4 years since then, with Paul Tardy in the organizing committee or in the lead, have\\n been providing important time markers of this evolution. Since then, major progress was\\n made by the introduction in most steel shops of secondary or ladle metallurgy, which was\\n invented in the process, while steel cleanliness was defined precisely in standards and\\n textbooks. The discoveries of pioneers have become state-of-the art and, today, a steady\\n state situation has been reached, where research continues in using new tools and methods\\n to refine the topic, while new comers, mainly from the BRIC countries, are contributing\\n their understanding of the topic to the international steel community. The distinction\\n between special steels and carbon steels got blurred in this historical process, as\\n similar secondary metallurgy tools were used for making both kinds of steels and, in\\n essence, steel ceased to be a simple commodity and most steels became special to some\\n extend. Clean steels have thus not become much more sophisticated recently, but rather\\n much more common and mainstream. The expression “clean steel” stems from a vision of the\\n purity of the metal in terms of minor elements, which had been controlled until then only\\n at the margin compared to the major elements, iron, carbon, silicon and manganese. This is\\n today a somewhat passéed vision as metallurgy has become a much more holistic and systemic\\n technology, whereby steels are defined in terms of global composition, of distribution of\\n phases, including the minor phases that are known as non-metallic inclusions, of\\n microstructures and, more often than not, in terms of applications and properties in\\n service. Moreover, steels have time extensions, which are discussed as life cycle or value\\n chain and are thus embedded in the anthroposphere and its intersection with the biosphere\\n and the geosphere. This emphasizes the fact that steels are made from raw materials,\\n primary and secondary – thus including scrap from recycling -, that they are transformed\\n into artifacts that participate to the life of society and eventually are disposed of at\\n end of life to feed back into the circular economy. This holistic vision is what we call\\n “environmental metallurgy”. It is linked to clean steel production and constitutes another\\n dimension of the cleanliness of steel.

{"title": "Inclusion characterisation – tool for measurement of steel cleanliness and process control: Part 1", "abstract": "Owing to increasing demand for high surface and internal quality finished steel products, it is imperative to study the factors that limit the production of such steels. In particular, non-metallic inclusions affect steel cleanliness and cause defects leading to worsening of desired mechanical properties and service life of steel products. Other detrimental effects of inclusions are poor steel castability often resulting in slab downgrades and rejections, increased costs associated with recycling of liquid steel and refractories, and even shut down of the caster. Inclusion engineering is thus important to achieve process and quality control on a daily production basis. This article, in two parts, addresses inclusion characterisation as a tool for understanding and improving process conditions, minimising nozzle clogging and reducing sliver rejections in Ti stabilised ultra low carbon steels, Ca treated low carbon Al killed steels and advanced high strength steels. The paper begins with a survey of techniques followed by examples of use of techniques to resolve steelmaking and casting issues that affect quality of steel. Part I explains the use of an automated scanning electron microscope to correlate inclusion data with industrial process conditions. Examples include effect of different samplers, influence of ferroalloy quality and temperature control practices, ratio of elemental chemistries, ladle stirring etc. on quality of steel.", "source": "https://openalex.org/W1990075851", "pdf_url": null, "year": 2009, "country": "USA", "authors": ["P.

{"title": "Effect of the Tundish Gunning Materials on the Steel Cleanliness", "abstract": "Abstract To clarify the interaction mechanism between distinct tundish gunning materials (GM) and liquid steel, two kinds of gunning materials, namely MgO, Al 2 O 3 GM, were tested. SEM, EDS, XRD and chemical analysis were carried out for steel and GM to investigate the change of chemical composition of steel in contact with GM and the interface microstructure between steel and GM after high temperature holding experiments. The steel cleanliness in terms of inclusion number density, size and size distribution was evaluated. It was found that the reducible component, low-melting-point phases and the pores in GM were passageway for steel penetration. The Al 2 O 3 GM was less prone to steel penetration due to its poor wetting and the dense transition layer. MgO GM provided more oxygen and showed a stronger oxidizing capacity due to its higher content of reducible oxides (10.5 wt.% SiO 2 +2 wt.% Fe 2 O 3 ). The use of Al 2 O 3 GM resulted in an improved steel cleanliness and consequently could be a promising refractory in the tundish lining.", "source": "https://openalex.org/W2884014227", "pdf_url": null, "year": 2017, "country": "China", "authors": ["Yu Liu", "Guangqiang Li", "Li Wang", "Zhao Zhang"], "query": "steel cleanliness"}
{"title": "Influence of Modified Casting Practice on Steel Cleanliness", "abstract": "Consistently high level of cleanliness needs to be ensured, particularly in grades of steel used for critical applications. In addition, preventing the formation of alumina rich non-deformable inclusions is important in high carbon steels for the deep drawing applications. In the present work, influence of billet caster up-gradation on the overall cleanliness of high carbon steel has been investigated, mechanical characteristics of oxide inclusions evaluated and assessment of the existing deoxidation practice have been done. In general, there has been improvement in the overall level of steel cleanliness due to increasing tundish capacity, submerge pouring of liquid steel and application of in-mold EMS. These measures have effectively controlled the inclusions originating from reoxidation of liquid steel. However, the characteristics of the oxide inclusions generated during the deoxidation process in ladle remained same even after the caster up-gradation. The conventional deoxidation practice was found to generate mostly inclusions of variable compositions and alumina rich non-deformable inclusions, which makes the steel less suitable for very fine wire drawing applications. Appropriate measures have been proposed for further improvement in the inclusion characteristics while processing those grades of steels during the secondary steelmaking.", "source": "https://openalex.org/W2312573507", "pdf_url": "https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/isijinternational/51/4/51_4_557/_pdf", "year": 2011, "country": "IN", "authors": ["S.

Steel and slag samples were taken from two steel grades with a slightly different composition, but with similar processing conditions. Thereafter, the chemical compositions of the steel and slag samples were determined. The results show that the sum of the FeO and MnO was found to be a clear indicator for when reoxidation had taken place. No conclusive indicator was found to predict the extent of slag carry-over from the electric arc furnace. However, most of the variation in deoxidation seem to originate from the accuracy of the slag raking. Steel grades with low amounts of deoxidisers such as C and Si naturally were found to result in higher oxygen contents at the start of deoxidation. Furthermore, calculations of oxygen activities in the steel melt were made and the results were compared to measurements with varying results. Overall, the results indicate that calculation of oxygen activities with multivalence slag species such as Fe and Cr requires additional measurements to obtain accurate results.", "source": "https://openalex.org/W2402829607", "pdf_url": null, "year": 2016, "country": "SE", "authors": ["Karin Steneholm", "Nils Andersson", "Anders Tilliander", "Pär G.

Calcium treatment is done regularly at the end of ladle treatment to avoid clogging of submerged entry nozzles (SEN). With calcium consumption of 0.23 kg/t, inconsistent calcium in steel, SEN clogging and slide gate erosions were reported. Nozzle clogging during casting of LCAK steels was primarily caused by deposition of complex oxide and sulfide inclusions and slide gate erosion by excess calcium in steel. Optimum calcium in steel was essential to achieve desired inclusion composition conducive to smooth casting and eliminate slide gate or SEN erosion effectively. With calcium consumption of 0.12kg/ton optimum calcium content in steel could be achieved through i) improved steel cleanliness, ii) restricted CaS formation and iii) optimum aluminium content in steel. Process optimisation resulted in reduction in aluminium consumption by 1.0 kg/t and improvement in steel cleanliness with consistent total oxygen level of ≤ 42 ppm. Desired inclusion characteristics conducive to longer sequence length was achieved and evidenced through EPMA.

{"title": "Study of the Influence of Intermix Conditions on Steel Cleanliness", "abstract": "Modern steel plants produce today a large portfolio of various steel grades, many for end-uses demanding high quality. In order to utilize the maximum productivity of the continuous-casting machine, it is sometimes necessary to cast steel grades with different chemical compositions in one sequence. It is important, therefore, to know the possibilities of a specific continuous-casting machine to make the Intermix connections as short as possible. Any interference with established procedures may, however, have a negative impact on the cleanliness of the cast steel. Using physical and numerical simulation tools, it was found that reducing the steel level in the tundish during the exchange of ladles makes it possible to shorten the transition zone. However, when the steel level is reduced, the flow of steel is impaired, which can have a negative effect on the cleanliness of the cast steel and, in extreme cases, may even lead to entrapment of slag in the mold. The cleanliness of cast steel was evaluated using one of the most advanced tools for automatic steel cleanliness evaluation, AZtecFeature (Oxford Instruments, Abingdon, UK), which enables determination of the type, size, distribution, and shape, as well as the chemical composition, of individual types of non-metal inclusions.", "source": "https://openalex.org/W2897656055", "pdf_url": "https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4701/8/10/852/pdf?version=1539953080", "year": 2018, "country": "SK", "authors": ["Branislav Buľko", "Marek Molnár", "Peter Demeter", "Dana Baricová", "Alena Pribulová"], "query": "steel cleanliness"}
{"title": "Functionalized Carbon‐Bonded Filters with an Open Porous Alumina Coating: Impact of Time on Interactions and Steel Cleanliness", "abstract": "Understanding interactions between filter and molten steel is essential to improve the purity of casted products by filtration. Characteristic, in situ formed layers on the surface of carbon‐bonded alumina filters result from these interactions. To comprehend their formation, this study illustrates the time dependency of the layer buildup. Therefore, reactions at the filter/steel interface under quasi static conditions are examined using spark plasma sintering (SPS) equipment. Immersion tests in a steel casting simulator, which provides close‐to‐reality conditions, complement these investigations. Microstructure and phase analyses reveal that interfacial reactions between filter and steel lead to a thin in situ formed layer on the filter surface. During a “reactive” stage, large polycrystalline alumina structures are formed. Thereby, material is transported both from the carbon‐bonded material underneath (i.e., gaseous reaction products) and from the molten steel (i.e., precipitating particles and endogenous inclusions) to the filter/steel interface. The formation of these alumina particles comes to an end as soon as the carbon supply, which triggers the dissolution and precipitation processes at the interface, is cut‐off. From that point on, endogenous inclusions are deposited on them (“active” stage). The filters were most efficient during the reactive stage, that is, as long as the interfacial reactions take place.", "source": "https://openalex.org/W2616128441", "pdf_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1002/adem.201700170", "year": 2017, "country": "Germany", "authors": ["Anne Schmidt", "Anton Salomon", "Steffen Dudczig", "Harry Berek", "David Rafaja"], "query": "steel cleanliness"}

The main purpose was to study the influence of impurities in the ferroalloys FeTi (FeTi70 and FeTi35) and FeP on steel cleanliness. Therefore, two steel grades [ultra low carbon (ULC) high Mn and ULC low Mn] to which these ferroalloys are added were chosen for the study. The number of Al based inclusions analysed with pulse discrimination analysis-optical emission spectroscopy was taken as a measure of steel cleanliness and compared using box plot analysis and through a t test for different grades of FeTi additions. The ferroalloy parameters as well as other major process parameters during secondary metallurgy were also correlated to the inclusion number density. The statistical analysis was supplemented with elemental (ferroalloy) recovery calculations based on the industrial data and FactSage, the equilibrium Fe-Al-P-O diagram and the inclusion extraction analysis. On the basis of this study, it is proposed that (1) FeTi70 is a comparatively cleaner ferroalloy than FeTi35 and (2) for FeP in ULC low carbon steel, the best addition practice to maintain a balance between P recovery and steel cleanliness is towards the end of decarburisation and before the addition of Al blocks. © 2012 Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining.", "source": "https://openalex.org/W1969931262", "pdf_url": null, "year": 2012, "country": "BE", "authors": ["Manish M.

{"title": "Investigation on the Effects of Ladle Change Operation and Tundish Cover Powder on Steel Cleanliness in a Continuous Casting Tundish", "abstract": "The multiphase flows involving steel—slag—air phases in a two‐strand tundish during ladle change are investigated using mathematical modeling. Experimental results from water modeling are used to validate the simulated results. Tundish cover powder (TCP) and steel samples are taken from eight heats in one sequence to evaluate the effect of the multiphase flows during ladle change on the composition of the TCPs and steel cleanliness. Furthermore, the effect of the refilling time on the air entrainment and slag aperture during ladle change is analyzed and discussed. It is found that the strong turbulent flows in the tundish impact zone during ladle change promote the mix of the two‐layer cover powder, which consists of a basic TCP layer at the bottom and a top layer of rice hull balls. It results in a significant change in the composition of the TCPs and gradually deteriorates the steel cleanliness by the slag—steel reaction. Increasing the refilling time can effectively decrease the amount of entrained air and area of slag layer aperture in the tundish bath during ladle change. To reduce the steel reoxidation during ladle change, the refilling time should be larger than 184 s. Moreover, a new TCP is developed instead of the top layer of rice hull balls in industrial production. The use of the new TCP significantly improves the steel cleanliness in the tundish.", "source": "https://openalex.org/W3173586827", "pdf_url": null, "year": 2021, "country": "China", "authors": ["Rui Xu", "Haitao Ling", "Haijun Wang", "Lizhong Chang", "Shengtao Qiu"], "query": "steel cleanliness"}

However, PDA-OES measures only the number of inclusions present in the steel irrespective of size. In the present paper, the potential of PDA to determine the inclusion size is evaluated by employing two methodologies: (i) obtaining the average inclusion size by dividing the difference of total and soluble aluminium concentration by the number of Al based inclusions for 200 industrial ULC heats and (ii) measuring the Al concentration for individual peak intensity for specific heats, giving the inclusion size distribution.

Its main function is to remove undesirable gases. However, during this process, flotation phenomenon and inclusions absorption are reported. The aim of the present work was to study the slag viscosity and vacuum degassing (tank type) capacity in steel cleanliness from an industry perspective. To achieve this objective, slag and steel samples were taken before and after the vacuum stage. The results in steel cleanliness were related to a kinetic stirring parameter (βs) of the vacuum station and to the effect of slag viscosity. The removal of inclusions during the vacuum stage reached 64, 75 and 78% in the diameter ranges of 2.5-5, 5-15 and ≥ 15 µm, respectively. After the degassing process, the composition of non-metallic inclusions seemed to approach the slags' chemical compositions. The stirring process in the vacuum degassing station promotes a significant decrease in the inclusion densities for the 2.5-15 µm diameter range and also in the sulfur content in liquid steel.

As the content of Mg increases, the content of O and S in steel decreases significantly, with O content as low as 0.0002% and S content as low as 0.0008%. Almost all inclusions in ultra-high Mg steel are magnesium-bearing oxide, sulfide, even carbide. As the content of Mg increases, the number of inclusions in the steel increases and the size decreases. But if too much Mg is added into the steel, the size and number of inclusions will rapid increase. The as-cast secondary dendrite spacing of steel decreased obviously with the increase of Mg content in steel. As the content of Mg increases, the as-cast microstructure changes from lamellar pearlite to granular pearlite. The phase diagram of SKS51 steel was calculated by Thermal-calc software.

In all steel samples, a pick-up of Al, Si and C was observed. For the refractories containing antioxidants, longer holding times seem to increase the number density of inclusions, especially in combination with a slag with lower MgO content. For the given experiments, the beneficial role of antioxidants against slag corrosion was not observed, possibly due to the low pO2, which prevented C oxidation.

{"title": "Quantitative Analysis of Inclusion Engineering on the Fatigue Property Improvement of Bearing Steel", "abstract": "The fatigue property is significantly affected by the inner inclusions in steel. Due to the inhomogeneity of inclusion distribution in the micro-scale, it is not straightforward to quantify the effect of inclusions on fatigue behavior. Various investigations have been performed to correlate the inclusion characteristics, such as inclusion fraction, size, and composition, with fatigue life. However, these studies are generally based on vast types of steels and even for a similar steel grade, the alloy concept and microstructure information can still be of non-negligible difference. For a quantitative analysis of the fatigue life improvement with respect to the inclusion engineering, a systematic and carefully designed study is still needed to explore the engineering dimensions of inclusions. Therefore, in this study, three types of bearing steels with inclusions of the same types, but different sizes and amounts, were produced with 50 kg hot state experiments. The following forging and heat treatment procedures were kept consistent to ensure that the only controlled variable is inclusion. The fatigue properties were compared and the inclusions that triggered the fatigue cracks were analyzed to deduce the critical sizes of inclusions in terms of fatigue failure. The results show that the critical sizes of different inclusion types vary in bearing steels. The critical size of the spinel is 8.5 μm and the critical size of the calcium aluminate is 13.5 μm under the fatigue stress of 1200 MPa. In addition, with the increase of the cleanliness of bearing steels, the improvement of fatigue properties will reach saturation. Under this condition, further increasing of the cleanliness of the bearing steel will not contribute to the improvement of fatigue property for the investigated alloy and process design.", "source": "https://openalex.org/W2942126808", "pdf_url": "https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4701/9/4/476/pdf?version=1556103550", "year": 2019, "country": "China", "authors": ["Chao Gu", "Min Wang", "Yanping Bao", "Fuming Wang", "Junhe Lian"], "query": "inclusion engineering"}

However, the role of stress within engineering culture and its implications for engineering programs have not been fully explored in the literature. Purpose/Hypothesis The purpose of this study was to measure and examine the relationships among self‐reported stress, anxiety, and depression; engineering identity; and perceptions of inclusion of undergraduate engineering students. Design/Method We validated a quantitative survey instrument built on previously published scales and used it to measure self‐reported stress, anxiety, and depression; engineering identity; and perceptions of inclusion. Results Our findings indicate that self‐reported levels of stress, anxiety, and depression are high for engineering students. Further, levels of stress and anxiety are significantly higher for female students, while levels of depression are higher for first‐generation students. We find correlations between self‐reported mental health symptoms, engineering identity, and perceptions of inclusion, and these relationships differ by gender. Lastly, we find that students underrepresented in engineering rate their departments as less diverse than their peers. Conclusions Our results suggest that perceptions of inclusion and engineering identity are related to student mental health, further emphasizing the importance of developing inclusive cultures in engineering programs.

{"title": "Inclusion Engineering in Medium Mn Steels: Effect of Hot-Rolling Process on the Deformation Behaviors of Oxide and Sulfide Inclusions", "abstract": "Abstract Medium Mn steel (MMS) is a new category of the third-generation advanced high strength steel (3rd AHSS) which is developed in the recent 1-2 decades due to a unique trade-off of strength and ductility. Thus, this steel grade has a wide application potential in different fields of industry. The current work provides a fundamental study of the effect of hot-rolling on the inclusion deformation in MMS including a varied 7 to 9 mass pct Mn. Specifically, the deformation behavior of different types of inclusions ( i.e. , Mn(S,Se), liquid oxide (MnSiO 3 ), MnAl 2 O 4 , and complex oxy-sulfide) was investigated. The results show that both MnSiO 3 and Mn(S,Se) are soft inclusions which are able to be deformed during the hot-rolling process but MnAl 2 O 4 does not. The aspect ratio of soft inclusions increases significantly from as-cast to hot-rolling conditions. When the maximum size of different inclusions is similar, Mn(S,Se) deforms more than MnSiO 3 does. This is due to a joint influence of physical parameters including Young’s modulus, coefficient of thermal expansion (α), etc. However, when the maximum size of one type of inclusion ( e.g., MnSiO 3 ) is much larger than another one ( e.g., Mn(S,Se)), this maximum size of soft inclusions plays a dominant role than other factors. In addition, the deformation behavior of dual-phase inclusion depends on the major phase, i.e. , either oxide or sulfide. Last but not least, empirical correlations between the reduction ratio of the thickness of plate, grain size, and aspect ratio of oxide and sulfide inclusions after hot-rolling are provided quantitatively. This work aims to contribute to the ‘inclusion engineering’ concept in the manufacturing of new generation AHSS.", "source": "https://openalex.org/W4229013520", "pdf_url": "https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11663-022-02517-2.pdf", "year": 2022, "country": "China", "authors": ["Yong Wang", "Yonggang Yang", "Zhihua Dong", "Joo Hyun Park", "Zhenli Mi"], "query": "inclusion engineering"}

{"title": "Inclusion engineering of steel to prevent chemical tool wear", "abstract": "AbstractAbstractTrent introduced the concept of tribological conditions of seizure at the tool–chip interface, when the normal pressure exceeds the flow stress of asperities so that the asperities are squeezed to make atomic contact. In consequence, chemical dissolution of the tool into the chip occurs by a diffusion mechanism, causing chemical wear. Oxley incorporated the concept of seizure in his quantitative model for flow chip morphology. Oxley introduced the concept of equilibrium shear angle in his quantitative model for flow chip morphology, which incorporates the work of shear in the secondary shear zone instead of friction, once atomic contact is established, but Oxley's model ignored potential interaction from metallurgical softening events in the secondary shear zone, which led to prediction of unrealistically high temperature at high cutting speeds. In fact, metallurgical softening events do occur particularly at high cutting speeds, causing shear localisation, which leads to significant deviation from Oxley's model predictions. In this paper, Oxley's model will be extended to capture the interaction of shear localisation in the secondary shear zone on the mechanics of metal cutting. Dynamic recrystallisation, phase transformation of the matrix and geometric softening owing to second phase particles are identified as important microstructural softening events causing shear localisation, which could intervene before the equilibrium shear angle is reached. The occurrence of shear localisation is shown to alter the mechanics of metal cutting, chip morphology and the tool wear mechanism. A phenomenological database in model alloys will be presented to validate the model assumptions. The application of the model in the design of self-lubricating free cutting steel for moderate and high cutting speeds will be examined.Keywords: METAL CUTTINGFERROUS ALLOYSCHIP FORMATIONSOFTENINGTOOL WEAR", "source": "https://openalex.org/W2170265315", "pdf_url": null, "year": 2004, "country": "Unknown", "authors": ["S.

Homochiral stacks of PHTP molecules surround polar chains of hydrogen-bonded NPP molecules in a channel-type, honeycomb architecture. The NPP chains are arranged in an all-parallel (rather than an antiparallel) fashion. Crystals of [PHTP]5[NPP] show second harmonic generation for incident light of wavelength 1064 nm, an electro-optical and a pyroelectric effect. The X-ray diffraction pattern exhibits Bragg-like reflections, interspersed with planes of diffuse scattering and weak satellite reflections superimposed on these planes, features which are indicative of extensive disorder. In spite of this, an orthorhombic average structure model could be deduced from the Bragg-like reflections (space group Cmc21, a = 15.023(2), b = 23.198(2), and c = 4.730(1) Å (T = 100 K), wR2 = 0.088, goodness of fit 1.38). A qualitative interpretation of diffuse and satelite scattering is given. Crystals of [PHTP]5[NPP] are approximately hexagonal prisms. If the tailor-made additive 1-(p-tolyl)piperazine (TP) is present during crystallization, the habit changes to approximately hexagonal plates and TP is incorporated in small amounts. Crystals of the composition [PHTP]5[NPP]0.93[TP]0.07 lose the ability of second harmonic generation. The observation of polar properties for a crystal structure whose polar building blocks, the -NO2···HN- hydrogen-bonded NPP chains, are 14−15 Å apart and separated by PHTP hydrocarbon molecules is surprising, but can be explained in terms of a Markov chain model of crystal growth. The same simple model accounts for the loss of polarity in the presence of the tailor-made additive TP. The knowledge gained during the present analysis provides a rational tool for the engineering of polar properties of PHTP and similar channel-type inclusion compounds.", "source": "https://openalex.org/W1977977739", "pdf_url": null, "year": 1997, "country": "CH", "authors": ["Olaf König", "Hans‐Beat Bürgi", "Thomas Armbruster", "J.

{"title": "Design of corrosion-resistant alloys for preventing oxidation-induced nanoscale Cr-depletion by inclusion engineering", "abstract": "Due to the preferential oxidation of Cr in various corrosion-resistant alloys, Cr-depletion extensively forms around the oxides and impairs passivation ability. This harmful effect has been widely recognized, but available solutions are limited. Here, to prevent such oxidation-induced Cr-depletion in corrosion-resistant alloys, we proposed a general strategy based on inclusion engineering using oxygen-preferred elements in alloy design. The inclusion-Cr depletion-passivation relationship was systematically studied in 3.5 wt% NaCl using commercially cast original, Si-modified, Al-modified, and Ti-modified CoCrFeMnNi alloys, in which the prominent inclusions were identified as MnCr2O4, MnO-SiO2, AlN, and TiN, respectively. Unlike the original alloy, all modified alloys prevented Cr-depletion with improved corrosion resistance; however, the Si-modified alloy exhibited the most remarkable improvement due to few nitride by-products. Thermodynamic analysis on the free energy changes of potential reactions revealed that all the additives were preferential to be oxidized over Cr, whereas Al and Ti nitridation reactions have the most negative free energies compared to all oxidation reactions, which validated experimental results. From experiments and thermodynamics, an effective method was proposed, and its application was discussed with three newly-designed alloys prepared using arc melting. We believe the proposed strategy can be widely used in designing alloys to prevent oxidation-induced Cr-depletion.", "source": "https://openalex.org/W4400412803", "pdf_url": null, "year": 2024, "country": "HK", "authors": ["Kaiping Yu", "Hui Jiang", "Xiaomeng Xu", "Mingxin Huang"], "query": "inclusion engineering"}

This leads to the use of a Si killed route and control of the secondary steelmaking process to place the inclusion composition on the zone of the low melting point of the quaternary thermodynamical equilibrium MgO-CaO-SiO2-Al2O3. To verify the suitability of the process modifications (acid slags, low basicity, reduction of Al and Ti contents to be as low as possible) wire rod cleanness analysis and fatigue tests (Nakamura) were performed on a typical spring steel grade. Fatigue test results were promising, finding no inclusion as a cause of failure in several tested heats, which fulfils the usual cleanness and fatigue requirements.

In the third year, teachers in each school implemented the redesigned program on their own. Researchers conducted a mixed-methods study of the impact of the program on participants. The study used observations and interviews; social interaction analysis, a pre/post survey of science, technology, and engineering self-efficacy and career interest; and a pre/post assessment of understanding of the engineering design process (EDP). Autistic and neurotypical students were in either the treatment condition (if they joined the maker program) or a business-as-usual comparison condition (if they did not join the club).

The content is an expansion of work that was shared at the 2015 World Engineering Education Forum’s first special session on “Diversity &amp; Inclusion in Global Engineering.” Diversity and Inclusion (D&amp;I) are contextualized topics that shift objectives from country to country. The role of D&amp;I in engineering education and practice has gained prominence in recent years due to the fact that engineers are facing increased need for global collaborations and are expected to be able to work in highly diverse teams and within different cultures. D&amp;I initiatives in the field of engineering generally include gender, ethnicity, and national origin, and may include persons who are economically underprivileged and persons with disabilities. While the prominence of D&amp;I has increased, international learning outcomes and collaborations within these efforts are limited. Within a global community a common platform would allow for the sharing of best practices and maximize learning opportunities and impact. By examining models from around the world, we can begin to consolidate, optimize, and disseminate the global benefits of D&amp;I.

{"title": "Measuring underrepresented student perceptions of inclusion within engineering departments and universities", "abstract": "Despite efforts made by the engineering community, the struggle to increase racial and ethnic diversity continues. As women andethnic minorities make up a larger percentage of the United States labor force, academic departments need to support thedevelopment of students from these talent pools. To improve the retention of these students, engineering departments need to beinclusive, allowing students to feel welcomed, valued, respected, and supported. The overall purpose of this study was to developand pilot a survey instrument, grounded in Tinto’s Model of Institutional Departure, to provide engineering educators andadministrators with a tool that can be used to investigate how underrepresented engineering students rate the level of inclusionwithin engineering departments, paying close attention to gender and race/ethnicity. Herein we specifically report on the instrumentdevelopment and the initial findings through data collected from two public, predominately White research institutions with highundergraduate engineering student enrollment. Our results demonstrate that the Engineering Department Inclusion Level (EDIL)survey can yield valid and reliable scores with the population of interest. Before embarking on further data collection to continuedeveloping the survey, we wanted to determine what value the survey might have. Results indicate no differences between men andwomen from underrepresented populations but that African-Americans rated the same environments less inclusive than otherracial/ethnic groups across all of the scales. Finally, PhD students scored University Pride lower than participants at otheracademic levels. Moreover, based on initial data results, we suggest further research on feelings of inclusion as an important aspectto creating a diverse environment.", "source": "https://openalex.org/W3028476738", "pdf_url": null, "year": 2014, "country": "Unknown", "authors": ["Walter Lee", "Holly Matusovich", "Philip R.

{"title": "Non-metallic inclusions in steels – origin and control", "abstract": "Non-metallic inclusions (NMIs) play a key role in many important properties of steel, influencing both processing and application of steel products. In this work, the current understanding of the origin and classification of NMIs is reviewed, highlighting the dramatic development of the last decades. This includes the discussion of the thermodynamics of inclusion formation and the current knowledge on the effects of melt shop processing variable on NMIs composition, amount and size distribution. The development of inclusion engineering – tailoring the process to obtain the desired NMIs is highlighted and the development in selected areas – tire cord, springs and bearing steels as well as prevention of nozzle clogging – is used to illustrate this development. The promising field of “oxide metallurgy” is also discussed in the context of inclusion engineering. Finally, the difficulties in meaningfully characterizing and quantifying NMIs are briefly commented. In summary it is concluded that inclusion control in steels has evolved significantly in the last decades. This is due to the progress in understanding the interplay between thermodynamics, steel and slag chemical composition as well as melt shop processing. This made possible the tailoring of non-metallic inclusions via processing, to optimize steel properties. Nonetheless, some important problems remain and must still be solved to improve inclusion control and optimization.

{"title": "The Complexity of Nonbinary Gender Inclusion in Engineering Culture", "abstract": "Abstract Gender in engineering is a long-standing source of inquiry, research, outreach, and discussion as inequity in demographics and negative experiences persist in the field. Women consist of just approximately 20% of our engineering undergraduate programs nationally, and roughly 14% of our national professional workforce. Absent from these numbers and research into gender minority experiences are students who lay further on the margins of discussion, awareness, inclusion, and acknowledgement of existence - students who identify as nonbinary or other genders aside from man or woman. This paper presents background literature on gender, gender minority experiences in higher education, nonbinary gender identity, and aims to present points of discussion to facilitate further engagement with a more nuanced understanding of gender in engineering. Gender as a social system is defined by multiplicity and fluidity and does not fit within two unitary and discrete categories. The majority of current gender in engineering scholarship utilizes a conceptualization of gender which does not acknowledge or incorporate more than two gender options, and is rooted in increasingly rejected notions of biological essentialism. Nonbinary and gender nonconforming students, some of which also identify within the transgender population, exist in liminal spaces throughout society and higher education, and continuation of this scholarship tacitly denies their existence by framing gender as intrinsically linked to two biological categories. Engineering professionals, faculty, and students who identify as neither men nor women must be included and our conversation be expanded for academically rigorous investigation into gender dynamics and create inclusive engineering spaces. Conversations around gender neutral bathrooms are just the beginnings of widespread cultural change to support gender expansive engineers. The discipline must re-think our approaches towards gender equity in engineering and the theoretical conceptualization of gender to not only frame its inequity through the sharp underrepresentation of women, but its gender dynamics as experienced by nonbinary and gender nonconforming students. We must continue to make space for marginalized gender identities and gendered experiences. Through reviewing existing literature and integrating my own intimate experiences I seek to discuss preliminary efforts towards nonbinary inclusion in our teaching, professionalization, and language. This paper represents a point of entry for discussing nonbinary inclusion as part of the discipline's continued commitment to cultural change surrounding gender.", "source": "https://openalex.org/W3084088802", "pdf_url": "https://strategy.asee.org/31084.pdf", "year": 2020, "country": "USA", "authors": ["Andrea Haverkamp"], "query": "inclusion engineering"}
{"title": "Engineering Deans' Support For LGBTQ Inclusion", "abstract": "Over the last several years, scholars have started to investigate processes of disadvantage and exclusion faced by lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer (LGBTQ) faculty, students and professionals in engineering. Although this research is only beginning to document the contours of these issues, it suggests that successful social change in engineering requires that equality and inclusion be advanced through multiple fronts in engineering education, including the policies and perspectives of engineering administrators and leaders. In this paper, we draw on survey data (currently being collected) from over 40 deans and Program Directors of U.S. Engineering and Engineering Technology colleges and programs to understand their views on LGBTQ-inclusive practices and policies. In particular, our paper describes (1) deans’ assessment of the climate in their college for LGBTQ students and faculty, (2) deans’ personal support for LGBTQ equality and inclusion measures (e.g. faculty-wide Safe Zone training, hiring initiatives, inclusion of LGBTQ status in non-discrimination statements in job advertisements) and (3) deans’ perception of support among their faculty and students for LGBTQ inclusion measures. These findings provide important insights into the cultural and policy landscapes in engineering education for LGBTQ individuals and the (un)supportiveness of this key group of stakeholders of the promotion of LGBTQ equality.", "source": "https://openalex.org/W2594946378", "pdf_url": "https://peer.asee.org/26633.pdf", "year": 2016, "country": "USA", "authors": ["Erin A.

This study explored Ce3+-doped Tb3Al5−xScxO12 crystals (where x ranges from 0.5 to 3.0), revealing a novel approach to control luminescence and photoconversion through atomic size mismatch engineering. Raman spectroscopy confirmed the coexistence of garnet and perovskite phases, with Sc substitution significantly influencing the garnet lattice and induced A1g mode softening up to Sc concentration x = 2.0. The Sc atoms controlled sub-eutectic inclusion formation, creating efficient light scattering centers and unveiling a compositional threshold for octahedral site saturation. This modulation enabled the control of energy transfer dynamics between Ce3+ and Tb3+ ions, enhancing luminescence and mitigating quenching. The Sc admixing process regulated luminous efficacy (LE), color rendering index (CRI), and correlated color temperature (CCT), with adjustments in CRI from 68 to 84 and CCT from 3545 K to 12,958 K. The Ce3+-doped Tb3Al5−xScxO12 crystal (where x = 2.0) achieved the highest LE of 114.6 lm/W and emitted light at a CCT of 4942 K, similar to daylight white.

All of the racemic dibromides 2–4 and 6 form clathrate compounds where their opposite enantiomers are joined edge–edge by means of C–H⋯N dimers. Hence this interaction is robust and of considerable value in crystal engineering. Modification of the benchmark centrosymmetric aryl–H⋯N dimer can result, however, in more complex modifications which better suit a given host–guest combination. Therefore a range of different C–H⋯N dimers is observed, with the new motif present in (6)·(benzene)1.5 completing a sub-set of these variants.

{"title": "Building Inclusion in Engineering Teaming Practices", "abstract": "Background: Teamwork is a commonplace component of engineering practice. Engineering educators have been studying ways to make teams more effective and inclusive. However, students’ interpersonal interactions often create exclusionary experiences. Purpose/Hypothesis: This study investigates how the team formation process and what kinds of teaming practices and behaviors promote inclusive team environments. We were sensitized to Tuckman and Jensen’s (1977) revised theory of the five stages of teaming along with opportunity structures theory as frameworks to study how particular team interactions did or did not promote the inclusion of its members. Design/Method: This interpretive multi-case study used team observations, classroom artifacts, and student interviews in a first-year engineering course to understand the experiences of three teams. The primary data source, student interviews, were analyzed to understand the individual and collective team experience. These results were triangulated with the other data sources to build three team descriptions and a cross-team comparison. Results: Our findings indicate that the process of storming and norming in teams is an essential point in which social inclusion is built into teaming practices or not. While all teams, regardless of inclusive behaviors, were academically successful, the inclusive norms developed by some teams increased student learning and belonging. Conclusions: The emphasis on teaming in engineering education has often focused on the effectiveness of teams for a final project. However, the process of teaming and how peers shape the engineering environment is just as important for student’s belonging and persistence. The results of this work can provide strategies for supporting students’ teaming processes to develop more inclusive teams.", "source": "https://openalex.org/W4379053101", "pdf_url": "https://storage.googleapis.com/jnl-vt-j-see-files/journals/1/articles/84/6478309ee4876.pdf", "year": 2023, "country": "USA", "authors": ["Héctor Rodríguez-Simmonds", "Allison Godwin", "Tara Langus", "Nelson Pearson", "Adam Kirn"], "query": "inclusion engineering"}

Besides, thermodynamic diagram among magnesium, aluminum, and oxygen as well as calcium, magnesium, aluminum, and oxygen in the steel melt were studied to understand the fundamentals of inclusion modification by calcium treatment in LCAK steel. Furthermore, the change mechanisms of oxide inclusions and the precipitation of calcium sulfide were discussed. The experimental results showed that oxide inclusions were partly changed along with the path of Al2O3→MgO·Al2O3→(MgO·)CaO·Al2O3, which was a little different from the thermodynamic calculation results due to the limited kinetic conditions. Calcium treatment somehow modified the inclusions, however, many large inclusions were generated, and the modification effect would be dramatically decreased by the formation of large amount of CaS inclusions, which appeared with three main distribution forms.

{"title": "Thermodynamic examination of inclusion modification and precipitation from calcium treatment to solidified steel", "abstract": "AbstractAbstractCalcium treatment is a well established method to transform oxide and sulphide inclusions in steel to less harmful inclusions which can have beneficial effects on properties. Transformation of solid alumina clusters to liquid calcium aluminates by calcium is a much used technique to avoid nozzle blocking in continuous casting of aluminium deoxidised steels. Calcium treatment is also a key method to improve machinability, which can be further improved by increased sulphur content. Resulphurised steels, however, tend to have casting problems due to deficient modification of oxides or formation of solid CaS inclusions which also have a tendency to clog the nozzle. In this study, the formation and transformation of liquid and solid inclusions containing oxidic and sulphidic components were examined by thermodynamic calculations. A quasichemical slag model was applied to calculate equilibrium oxide and sulphide inclusions in steel. Calculations were carried out over a wide temperature range to study the formation of species in the melt corresponding to ladle treatment conditions as well as casting. To examine inclusion behaviour during casting and solidification, the interdendritic solidification model, IDS, was coupled with thermodynamic equilibrium calculations. The results show the conditions in which liquid inclusions can be formed with calcium treatment. The calculations were performed at different temperatures and varying calcium, aluminium and sulphur contents. The effect of total oxygen content was also studied. The main components in liquid calcium aluminates were CaO and Al2O3 plus some SiO2 and CaS. The stability relations of different compounds alter as a function of temperature. An abrupt change occurs during solidification when the partition of the inclusion forming elements between the liquid and solid iron phases are taken into account.", "source": "https://openalex.org/W1976228831", "pdf_url": null, "year": 2003, "country": "Unknown", "authors": ["Lauri Holappa", "Marko Hämäläinen", "Matti Liukkonen", "Minna Lind"], "query": "calcium treatment steel"}
{"title": "Effect of Al Content on the Characteristics of Inclusions in Al–Ti Complex Deoxidized Steel with Calcium Treatment", "abstract": "To improve the effect of calcium treatment and the cleanliness of steel and to make use of fine TiOx to refine the microstructure of steel, the effect of aluminum content on inclusion characteristics of aluminum-titanium complex deoxidized and calcium treated steel is investigated based on the experiment with SEM/EDS, Image Pro-Plus 6.0 and FactSage 6.1 softwares and thermodynamic calculation in the present work. The results show that the inclusions in two steels with different aluminum content are obviously spherical composite inclusions with a two-layer complex structure, consisting of an Al2O3–CaO–TiOX core surrounded by MnS. In low aluminum steel, the oxide core of inclusions contains much TiOx and CaO, and their composite structure is mosaic compared with bundle in high aluminum steel, the number of inclusions is 2.5 times more than that in high aluminum steel, the thickness of MnS on oxides surface is also thinner. In addition, melting point of the inclusions in low aluminum steel is lower, the cleanliness of the steel is relatively improved because of the inclusions floating up, and the deformation aspect ratio of calcium aluminate inclusions with a certain amount of Ti2O3 is effectively improved, which is about 1–2 while the composition of oxide core is xAl2O3 = 35–55%, xTi2O3 = 15–35%, and xCaO = 10–25%. As a result, less calcium is needed to modify the alumina inclusions to liquid calcium aluminate in the case of lower aluminum deoxidized steel, thus the calcium treatment effect can be improved. The low aluminum in steel is more effective to control the inclusion characteristics to reduce the harm of MnS and to improve the cleanliness of steel.", "source": "https://openalex.org/W2077001559", "pdf_url": "https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/isijinternational/54/8/54_1755/_pdf", "year": 2014, "country": "China", "authors": ["Wan Zheng", "Zhenhua Wu", "Guangqiang Li", "Zhan Zhang", "Chengyi Zhu"], "query": "calcium treatment steel"}

With calcium consumption of 0.23 kg/t, inconsistent calcium in steel, SEN clogging and slide gate erosions were reported. Nozzle clogging during casting of LCAK steels was primarily caused by deposition of complex oxide and sulfide inclusions and slide gate erosion by excess calcium in steel. Optimum calcium in steel was essential to achieve desired inclusion composition conducive to smooth casting and eliminate slide gate or SEN erosion effectively. With calcium consumption of 0.12kg/ton optimum calcium content in steel could be achieved through i) improved steel cleanliness, ii) restricted CaS formation and iii) optimum aluminium content in steel. Process optimisation resulted in reduction in aluminium consumption by 1.0 kg/t and improvement in steel cleanliness with consistent total oxygen level of ≤ 42 ppm.

Samples of steel secondary treatment ( Ladle ) and continuous‐casting billets ( Tundish ) were obtained from an electric steel mill. Entry data for this study were obtained in heats carried out in the steel plant. Furthermore, analyses were performed with a Scanning Electron Microscope ( SEM ) and an Energy‐Dispersive Spectrometer ( EDS ), as well as chemical analysis of both steel and total oxygen. In the Ladle sample, after calcium addition, inclusions had concentrations between 30 and 45% CaO and consisted mainly of calcium‐aluminates with MgO content of 10%. In the Tundish sample, inclusions contained a high percentage of alumina. Combining the characterization of inclusions with a computational thermodynamics model, the obtained results showed that the ideal range of calcium may vary between 10 and 14 ppm to form liquid inclusions with a minimum CaS content for the O, S and Al levels from SAE 8620 in this process stage. An analysis of Mg influence on the formation of calcium‐aluminates was also carried out. For contents of Mg found in aluminium‐killed steels treated with Ca, Mg does not significantly influence the formation of calcium‐aluminates inclusions. Higher calcium contents can be taken into account, depending on both the process type in steel production and the demanded product properties. The present study shows that the combined application of both inclusions characterization techniques and computational thermodynamics can drastically reduce the empiricism regarding the development of processes for the control of non‐metallic inclusions in steels.

The total oxygen (T.O.) content increased from 10 to 24 ppm just after the reoxidation occurred, while it finally decreased to 14 ppm since inclusions were floated to the top of the steel and absorbed by the formed slag layer. The increased T.O. favored the decomposition of CaS, especially for the heat with high sulfur contents. The vaporization of calcium, which leads to the decrease of calcium content, is the driving force for the evolution of inclusions from CaO-CaS-(Al 2 O 3 ) to CaO-Al 2 O 3 -(CaS) due to the limited degree of reoxidation. The contact angle between inclusions and the molten steel increased with the increase of Al 2 O 3 in calcium alumina, which favored the removal of inclusions. Increased sulfur content decreased the surface tension of molten steel, which led to remove less inclusions since the contact angle between inclusions and the molten steel was decreased.

{"title": "Calcium Treatment Of Plate Steels And Its Effect On Fatigue And Toughness Properties", "abstract": "ABSTRACT The effect of calcium treatment on the resulting nonmetallic inclusions and the mechanical properties of 3 plate steels, A5l6-70, A633C, and A5l4F is reported. Both conventional and calcium treated quality of the 3 plate steel grades are investigated. The inclusion types in the conventional quality of these aluminum-killed steels were found to be Type II manganese sulfides and alumina inclusion galaxies. Calcium treatment has been observed to prevent the formation of both of these detrimental inclusion types. The through-thickness tensile percent reduction area in all 3 plate steels was significantly improved by calcium treatment. The upper shelf Charpy-V-notch, dynamic tear and J-Integral fracture toughness were substantially improved in all testing orientations for all 3 steels by calcium treatment. Although the fatigue endurance limit and fatigue crack propagation properties were only slightly enhanced in A5l6-70 by calcium treatment, the fatigue crack propagation properties were significantly improved in A633C and A5l4F. INTRODUCTION Offshore structures and in particular offshore oil drilling platforms have to perform under severely stressed situations and in very harsh environments. For these reasons many of the steels used in platform construction have been newly developed or improved to meet this more stringent service application. ne improvement has been the development of steels with low sulfur levels and inclusion shape control through using Calcium Treatment, Lukens \"Fineline\"R. These steels resist \"lamellar tearing\" on welding during fabrication and also have enhanced toughness and fatigue properties to improve service performance. Calcium Treatment (CaT) quality plate steels have already been applied in various offshore structures, for example in node areas where lamellar tearing is a concern. Also CaT steels have been employed in cases where low temperature toughness is required or in deep water applications where high reliability is demanded. Steels produced by CaT have significantly lower levels of indigenous nonmetallic inclusions than steels produced using Conventional (CON) techniques. These inclusions precipitate as discrete phases during the solidification of molten steel, i.e. sulfides and oxides. A review of the CaT process in comparison to CON techniques, as well as the kinds of inclusions found will be given in this paper. CaT has been found to improve levels of tensile ductility, particularly in the through-thickness testing orientation, impact and fracture toughness and fatigue properties in a number of aluminum killed steels (1-6). In many instances the properties have approached, although not equalled, the quality of electroslag remelted (ESR) steels, which have previously been shown to supply a superior level of properties in plate steels. The steels used in offshore structures can have a wide range of strength levels. For this reason the properties of 3 different plate steel grades will be reported here namely, A5l6-70, A633C and A5l4F. These steels have minimum 0.2% offset yield strength minimums of 38 ksi (263 MPa), 50 ksi (345 MPa) and 100 ksi (690 MPa), respectively. Both CaT and CON quality steels in each grade will be examined.

The production practice in steel plant shows that for welding rod steels, the calcium content in a suitable range can meet the requirements of calcium treatment. Effective calcium treatment can not only transform the high melting point Al2O3 inclusions into the low melting point complex non-metallic inclusions between 3CaO·Al2O3 and 12CaO·7Al2O3, but also make the original shape-diversified inclusions into the spherical calcium-aluminate complex non-metallic inclusions.

{"title": "Fluid flow and mixing in secondary metallurgy", "abstract": "Mixing in metallurgical vessels is determined by bulk flow, turbulence and diffusion. In this presentation, the main features of mixing liquid steel by gas stirring are discussed. The criteria for bubbling and jetting during gas injection are considered including interaction of powder load on flow regimes. It is of interest to know the domains of bubbling and jetting behaviour in order to minimize the effect of back attack which is responsible for additional wear of bottom linings and tuyere pipes. Quantitative information is given on velocity, the radius and the pumping capacity of the buoyant plume. The relations lead to the conclusion that the gas flow should be apportioned to two or more plugs in order to increase the efficiency of the pumping effect. Furthermore, the macroscopic flow pattern is substantially influenced by the ratio of height to diameter of the ladle. Especially at high ratios dead volumes near the ladle bottom are observed. Further examples for the influence of fluid flow on reactions, dispersing and separating in the ladle and tundish are given. At first approach, mixing time depends on the gas flow rate or on the specific power input. But the details are much more complicated. It is shown that the mixing process can be described by two types of models among others: the turbulent recirculation model and the model of partial volumes. The comparison of calculated concentration‐time‐dependencies with plant results confirms the practicability and usefulness of the model of partial volumes. It is also concluded that the water model results for ladles may be transferred to plant conditions.

An improvement of the process control supported by knowledge of the thermodynamics and kinetics of the desulphurisation reaction is of great importance, especially for the production of steels with very low sulphur contents. To investigate the removal of sulphur, operational trials were carried out in 185 t steel ladles. In the trials the stirring gas flow rate, the pressure on the bath surface and the steel composition were varied as process parameters. The obtained results show that ladle slags saturated with lime have a high sulphide capacity.

{"title": "Computational Modelling of Oxide Surface Tensions in Secondary Metallurgy and Continuous Casting", "abstract": "Abstract Two computational models were used to estimate the surface tensions of oxide systems containing SiO 2 , CaO, Na 2 O and Al 2 O 3 as a function of temperature and composition. The compositions of the oxide melts were chosen to correspond to those of ladle slags in secondary metallurgy and to casting powders in continuous casting of steel. The first model uses Butler's equation to calculate the surface tensions of the multicomponent melts and is based on Tanaka et al.'s consideration of the ionic radii of the components as well as surface tensions and molar volumes of pure components. In the second model the same ionic radii dependent contribution is applied as activity coefficients to a constrained free energy model where the surface layer is considered as a separate phase in the system. In the model, the constrained interfacial area is analogous with a component mass balance in a traditional computation of a multiphase chemical equilibrium and surface energy with the corresponding chemical potential. Based on the results it is concluded that the effect of temperature on the surface tensions of the considered oxide melts is insignificant when compared to the effect of chemical composition. According to the validation the results agree well with published surface tension data. The multi‐component surface tension approach provides a practical method for evaluation of e.g. functioning of various casting powders in industrial steel casting practice.", "source": "https://openalex.org/W2022127024", "pdf_url": null, "year": 2010, "country": "FI", "authors": ["Eetu‐Pekka Heikkinen", "Jaana Riipi", "Timo Fabritius", "Risto Pajarre", "Pertti Koukkari"], "query": "secondary metallurgy"}

The factors controlling the distribution of reinforcement are also dependent on the initial processing method. Secondary fabrication methods, such as extrusion and rolling, are essential in processing composites produced by powder metallurgy, since they are required to consolidate the composite fully.

However, the release inventory of PCDD/Fs and dioxin-like PCBs is very scarce for these secondary nonferrous metallurgies. This study selected typical secondary zinc and lead plants to investigate the emissions of PCDD/Fs and dioxin-like PCBs released from such plants in China. The toxic equivalent quantity (TEQ) emission factor of PCDD/Fs and dioxin-like PCBs released into the environment is higher for secondary zinc production, at 52 298.02 ng TEQ ton(-1) than for secondary lead production, at 646.05 ng TEQ ton(-1). The most abundant congeners of PCDD/Fs are 2,3,4,7,8-PeCDF and 1,2,3,4,6,7,8-HpCDF for the secondary zinc and lead metallurgies, respectively. The most abundant congener of dioxin-like PCBs in the samples collected from both metallurgies is CB-126 . According to the distribution of PCDD/Fs (PCDF/PCDD >> 1) and the dominant contribution of higher chlorinated congeners, the de novo synthesis is assumed to be the main formation pathway of PCDD/Fs in the secondary zinc metallurgies. For the secondary lead metallurgies, the role of precursor formation is also very important. Based on the emission factor and production level, the total estimated emission amounts of PCDD/Fs and dioxin-like PCBs in both stack gas and fly ash released into the environment from secondary zinc and lead production is estimated to be at least 2.76 and 0.42 g TEQ yr(-1), respectively.

The aim of this study is to gain knowledge about the behavior of non-metallic inclusions at the interface between a growing solid front and a liquid phase. The focus is on the effect of the titanium and titanium oxide content on the inclusions and the different phenomena, which occurs at the solid/liquid interface. This was studied in samples of low-carbon steels de-oxidized by different combinations of Al, Ca, and Ti. For this purpose, each metal sample of 0.19 g was melted at a temperature close to 1550 A degrees C in an argon atmosphere and solidified under different solidification rates. A direct observation of inclusion behavior during solidification was made using a confocal scanning laser microscope equipped with an infrared gold image furnace. The alloying elements in the sample varied between: C 0.002-0.044; Si 0.02-1.33; Mn 0.12-1.33; P 0.003-0.016; S 0.003-0.01; Al 0.002-0,033; Ni 0-0.28; Cr 0-0.25; Ti 0.008-0.065; Ca 0.0007-0.002; O 0.002-0.0114 and N 0.0028-0.0056 (mass%).

The observed motions of the inclusions at the vicinity of the front of the solidifying steels were classified. At a low solidifying velocity and a small inclusion size, inclusions flowed away from the solidifying front. Furthermore, they also or got pushed a distance and thereafter flowed away from the interface. At a medium velocity and a slightly bigger size, inclusions tend to get pushed in front of the solidifying front. Another observation was that at a high velocity and a large particle size, inclusions tend to get engulfed or pushed and then engulfed by the progressing front.

Models for predicting slag properties (sulphide capacity, viscosity, and oxide activities) in liquid slags as functions of slag composition and temperature have been used for the calculation of data which have been employed in static and dynamic modelling of sulphur refining. The results from static modelling show that the method allows fast and easy evaluation of the theoretical desulphurisation conditions during degassing at Ovako Steel AB, as well as theoretical determination of the parameters that have the greatest influence on the equilibrium sulphur distribution. The conclusion from dynamic modelling is that the vacuum degassing operation can be described dynamically with the present knowledge of sulphide capacity, sulphur distribution, viscosity, and oxide activities of ladle slags if this knowledge is combined with fluid flow modelling to derive the overall kinetics.

The steel/slag reaction time and Al 2 O 3 content in slag had a great effect on inclusions characteristics. With the reaction time increasing from 30 to 180 minutes, inclusions experienced a transformation process: from mainly Al 2 O 3 MgO system and MgO‐based inclusions to spherical CaOMgOAl 2 O 3 system inclusions surrounded by a lower melting temperature surface layer of CaOAl 2 O 3 . Formation and transformation mechanisms of the inclusions were given based on the results. It was also found that with Al 2 O 3 content in slag reduced from 40% to 30%, [Mg] contents in steel melts were increased and MgO in slag reached saturation, which contributed to the formation of more MgO‐based inclusions and a more scattered inclusion composition distribution after 90 min reaction.", "source": "https://openalex.org/W1999437651", "pdf_url": null, "year": 2010, "country": "China", "authors": ["Min Jiang", "X.H.

The results show that as the aluminum is added into liquid steel, both the desilication rate and demanganization rate decrease, and the desulfurization rate increases rapidly. Meanwhile as the initial aluminum content [%YAl]t=0 exceeds 0.01 mass%, the desulfurization efficiency increases slowly.

Furthermore, the dual blowing gives higher desulfurization efficiency in comparison with the center blowing or eccentric blowing with one tuyere.

{"title": "Evolution of the Non-metallic Inclusions Influenced by Slag-Metal Reactions in Ti-Containing Ferritic Stainless Steel", "abstract": "Abstract Laboratory experiment and thermodynamic calculation for the Ti-containing 24 mass pct Cr ferritic stainless steel with a CaO-SiO 2 -Al 2 O 3 -MgO system slag were performed to investigate the effect of slag addition on the inclusion characteristics in molten steel. The morphology, composition, and size evolution of inclusions in steel samples were analyzed in three-dimensional by the electrolytic extraction method and in two-dimensional by the automatic analysis method. The results showed that the Ti content significantly decreased after the slag addition. However, the change of the Si content showed an opposite tendency. The decrease of the Ti content in steel was due to the reduction of SiO 2 and Al 2 O 3 in the slag by dissolved Ti in steel. An increase of the TiO 2 content in the slag can decrease the Ti loss in steel based on the slag-steel kinetic analysis. The total O content in the steel melt decreased from 62 to 26 ppm, and the steel cleanliness was improved, since the number density of inclusions decreased after the slag refining. The results of a kinetic analysis showed that the rate-determining step of the oxidation of Ti in the steel and the reduction of SiO 2 in the slag were the mass transfer on the slag side. In addition, high Ti 2 O 3 -containing inclusions were found to be transformed to Cr 2 O 3 -Ti 2 O 3 -Al 2 O 3 and Cr 2 O 3 -Ti 2 O 3 -SiO 2 system inclusions after the slag addition.

This indicated if only considering the slag-metal reaction, it’s better for high aluminum steel casting if the addition content of B2O3 is less than 5%. The chemical reaction was greatly influenced by the reaction time. With higher content of aluminum ([Al]=0.1 %), the early stage of reaction was greatly affected by the reaction time, and furtherly, the influence was decreased. When the aluminum content was increased, the effect of [Al] on the slag-metal reaction was comparatively small in the initial 10 min, and the content of [B] was increased slightly.

The scope does not include the materials properties of the weld metal. The latter may easily be optimised in the future by changing the weld metal chemistry once the process reactions of different element powders in SAW are understood. Aluminium as de-oxidiser element was applied to SAW to lower the oxygen partial pressure in the process. The results show the Al-Ni-Cr-Co-Cu alloyed weld metal total oxygen content was reduced to 257 ppm O, compared to the base case weld metal at 499 ppm O, made with the same flux and no metal powder additions. Thus, the aluminium that was added as a de-oxidiser element to the SAW process effectively lowered the original flux-induced partial oxygen pressure, both in the arc cavity and at the interface of the molten flux–weld pool phases. This partial oxygen pressure lowering effect of Al also prevents oxidation of Cr, preventing loss of Cr to the slag. Carbon steel was alloyed to 3.9% Al, 4.8% Ni, 4.9% Cr, 4.8% Co, 4.7% Cu at 62% Al yield, 76% Ni yield, 77% Cr yield, 75% Co yield, 74% Cu yield. SEM (scanning electron microscope) work on the three-dimensional (3D) post-weld slag sample show dome cavities with 3D rounded structures embedded in the dome cavity walls, as well as shards and nano-strands on the dome cavity walls. The 3D structures indicate vapour formation and re-condensation of oxy-fluorides. The novel application of the EERZ (effective equilibrium reaction zone) model simulates the mass transfer effects in the SAW process. This model is novel because it is the first model used to calculate the gas-slag-metal phase chemistry changes in SAW as a function of welding time. The novel SAW process modification of adding Al de-oxidiser powder with alloying element powders of the unique combination of Co-Cr-Co-Ni-Al was successfully applied.

To produce high-quality steel from DRI and steel scraps, molten steel composition in the melting process should be optimized considering the impurities originating in iron resources and conditions such as temperature and oxygen potential. In this study, the equilibrium of slag/metal reactions in the steelmaking process using DRI and steel scraps were thermodynamically analyzed, and the effect of using scrap on the composition of molten steel and slag and the conditions to produce low-phosphorous molten steel from high-P content DRI and steel scrap were discussed. The use of steel scrap showed such advantages as a decrease in the concentrations of Si, S, and P originating from high-P DRI, a decrease in the amount of slag, and a reduction in the amount of limestone required to maintain slag basicity.

The blast furnace and packed bed type partial smelting reduction process (PSR) are the most prospective reactors.

The effect of scrap ratio (iron mass ratio of scrap to scrap and sinter) on hot metal and molten slag composition was thermodynamically analyzed and the optimal composition of hot metal under controlled temperature and PO2 was investigated. Si and Mn were found to be significantly oxidized relative to the equilibrium state, and the S content was equal to that at equilibrium under a blast furnace condition.

The method of the estimation of PO2* is based on an assumption that a quasi-equilibrium is established in the slag-metal system at the time point when the phosphorus reaction changes its direction from dephosphorization to rephosphorization.The estimated PO2* ranges in the order of 10–11–10–10 Pa.

The oxygen potential of the bulk slag, PO2, s, is calculated with a regular solution model, and the comparison of the bulk slag's PO2, s with the interfacial oxygen potential, PO2*, shows that PO2* is 2-3 order or magnitude smaller than PO2, s.

The slagging reaction is a necessary process that oxidizes C, Mn, Si, P, S, and other impurities and therefore directly affects the quality of the resultant steel. Relevant research has suggested that intensifying the stirring effect can accelerate the slagging reaction and that the dynamic characteristics of the top blow are the key factor in exploring the related complex physical and chemical phenomena. To address the issue, the standard k-ω turbulence model and level-set method were adopted in the present work and a fluid dynamics model was developed for a BOF. Accordingly, the slag–metal–gas emulsion interaction and stirring effect were investigated, and the interference mechanism of a multi-nozzle supersonic coherent jet was revealed. Finally, a self-adjustment method based on fuzzy control is proposed for the oxygen lance. The results indicate that the transfer efficiency of jet kinetic energy at the gas–liquid interface is the critical factor for the slagging reaction and that multi-nozzle oxygen lances with a certain twisted angle have important advantages with respect to stirring effects and splashing inhibition. The fuzzy control method predicts that the optimal nozzle twist angle is within the range of 7.2° to 7.8°.

In this study, the rate of clogging was measured while casting steel through simulated nozzles produced from alumina, zirconia, magnesia, zirconia‐graphite, and alumina‐graphite ‐ three common base materials and two common carbon‐containing nozzle materials. Spent nozzles were characterized using optical and cathodoluminescence microscopy. Interactions between the nozzles and steel were not observed in the alumina, zirconia, and zirconia‐graphite nozzles. Slight interactions were observed in the magnesia nozzles as alumina inclusions within the steel interacted with the nozzle to produce alumina‐magnesia spinel. Greater amounts of interaction were observed with alumina‐graphite nozzles. No statistical differences in the mean rate of clogging were observed between all of the pure oxide nozzles and zirconia‐graphite nozzles. However, the alumina‐graphite nozzles clogged at a much higher rate than the other nozzles. The higher rate of clogging is thought to be due to refractory‐steel interactions.", "source": "https://openalex.org/W1632027946", "pdf_url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1002/srin.200606128", "year": 2006, "country": "USA", "authors": ["Luis Trueba", "Kent D.

{"title": "Inclusion Evolution and Estimation during Secondary Refining in Calcium Treated Aluminum Killed Steels", "abstract": "The objective of this study was to investigate the evolution of inclusions during secondary refining in aluminum killed steels. As calcium treatment is also used to modify solid alumina inclusions to liquid or partially liquid calcium aluminates for keeping free from nozzle clogging, a thermodynamic model has been calculated using Factsage to predict the type of calcium aluminates and sulfides present in the steel. The results showed that alumina generated from deoxidation had transformed to MgOAl2O3 spinel with a small amount of CaO by using high basicity and high Al2O3 slag during ladle furnace (LF) refining. Though soft blowing after LF refining is benefit for the removal of inclusions by floatation, vigorous stirring which may make slag layer exposing an \"eye\" to air reoxidation should be avoided. After calcium treatment, the inclusions were restricted mainly to globular calcium aluminates and the sulfur in the steel was associated with these inclusions as calcium sulfide. The ND (number density) of inclusions seems to appear a similar tendency to the size distribution of smaller inclusions, and the similar change between the AF (area fraction) of inclusions and the total oxygen content of the steel can be also found by careful comparison. Predicted inclusion type in the steel were validated with measurement based on samples collected from industrial heats and a reasonable range of Ca content was also given for the experimental steel.", "source": "https://openalex.org/W2032913721", "pdf_url": null, "year": 2014, "country": "China", "authors": ["Die Yang", "Xinhua Wang", "Guangwei Yang", "Pengyuan Wei", "HE Jin-ping"], "query": "aluminum killed steel"}

To assess whether liquid calcium aluminates do agglomerate in liquid steel, laboratory experiments were performed: melting electrolytic iron, deoxidizing the melt with aluminum and subsequently calcium treating the deoxidation products (alumina and magnesia-alumina spinel inclusions). Under laboratory conditions, solid spinels and alumina inclusions were successfully modified, producing a new population of much smaller calcium aluminate inclusions. The new population of inclusions forms because the presence of calcium in the liquid steel destabilizes alumina and MgO-alumina inclusions, which then dissolve into the melt. The liquid inclusions exhibited a weak but statistically significant tendency to agglomerate. Laboratory results were assessed in the light of different collision mechanisms. Agglomeration mainly occurs by Stokes and laminar fluid flow collision when no external stirring is imposed. Monte Carlo simulations of collisions agree reasonably well with experimental results.

{"title": "Influence of Slag and Refractory Materials on Inclusions during the Ladle Refining of Low Carbon Aluminum Killed Steel", "abstract": "The evolution of inclusions in low carbon Al killed steel during ladle refining of was studied based on industrial experiments, in which high basicity slag was used. The results showed that inclusions experienced the changes from Al2O3 → MgO-Al2O3 → CaO-MgO-Al2O3 → CaO-Al2O3. Without calcium treatment, MgO-Al2O3 inclusion in steel were largely transformed into CaO-MgO-Al2O3 or CaO-Al2O3. With the aim to decrease MgO-Al2O3 inclusions and to clarify the effects of refining slag and refractory materials on inclusions, laboratory experiments were performed with lower basicity refining slag (lower basicity slag theoretically helps reduce spinel-type inclusions) in MgO and Al2O3 crucibles.

To assess whether liquid calcium aluminates do agglomerate in liquid steel, laboratory experiments were performed: melting electrolytic iron, deoxidizing the melt with aluminum and subsequently calcium treating the deoxidation products (alumina and magnesia-alumina spinel inclusions). Under laboratory conditions, solid spinels and alumina inclusions were successfully modified, producing a new population of much smaller calcium aluminate inclusions. The new population of inclusions forms because the presence of calcium in the liquid steel destabilizes alumina and MgO-alumina inclusions, which then dissolve into the melt. The liquid inclusions exhibited a weak but statistically significant tendency to agglomerate. Laboratory results were assessed in the light of different collision mechanisms. Agglomeration mainly occurs by Stokes and laminar fluid flow collision when no external stirring is imposed. Monte Carlo simulations of collisions agree reasonably well with experimental results.

During the industrial production of the Al-killed Ca-treated steel, the Al2O3 content in CaO-Al2O3 inclusions increased from 72.05% to 79.83%, after the aluminum addition. In laboratory experiments, the addition of aluminum increased the Al2O3 content, and meanwhile lowered the contents of CaS and CaO in the inclusions. The average diameter of the inclusions decreased and the number density increased after the Al addition in steel, due to the formation of tiny inclusions. Based on the thermodynamic consideration, the transformation of the inclusions was attributed to the re-equilibrium of the reaction between steel and the inclusions after aluminizing. The Al2O3-riched calcium aluminate with a high melting point increased the possibility of the nozzle clogging during the continuous casting process, reducing the effect of the calcium treatment. Therefore, the addition of aluminum after calcium treatment should be avoided as far as possible.", "source": "semanticscholar:8d89df21dea1fc2c231c76b79f813d0eeec88392", "pdf_url": "https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4701/12/2/181/pdf?version=1642589713", "year": 2022, "country": "Unknown", "authors": ["Xingle Fan", "Lifeng Zhang", "Ying Ren"], "query": "aluminum killed steel"}
{"title": "Adaptive Neuro‐Fuzzy Inference System‐Long Short‐Term Memory Hybrid Model to Forecast Castability of Al‐Killed Steel Prior to Continuous Casting", "abstract": "Continuous casting of aluminum (Al) deoxidized steels demands careful inspection due to the occurrence of submerged entry nozzle (SEN) clogging, leading to unexpected production stops. Recognizing the castability of a specific “cast” by monitoring the condition of the SEN is essential for uninterrupted casting. With this information prior to casting, operators can take preventive action against possible clogging occurrences, thus reducing unplanned downtimes. In response to the severe implications of SEN clogging, this work introduces a novel way to forecast castability of Al‐killed steels. A hybrid model is proposed that integrates the adaptive neuro‐fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and long short‐term memory (LSTM) networks. The output of the model helps to anticipate the event of clogging by analyzing both the past condition of the SEN and changes in the steel chemistry during the transport of the steel ladle from refining to the casting process. A comprehensive analysis of 150 casts helped to build the ANFIS algorithm for estimating the castability index (CI) parameter from steel chemistry. LSTM algorithm is used as a subsequent step to forecast castability in the next 20–25 min. Discrepancies between the predictive response and the actual conditions are reported. Although the real‐time implementation of the proposed model is the ultimate goal, the focus of this work was to present the methodology and demonstrate its potential.", "source": "semanticscholar:d253db78af2f449cbf9393ad113a3d48a6d238d5", "pdf_url": "https://doi.org/10.1002/srin.202400220", "year": 2024, "country": "Unknown", "authors": ["S.

The results showed that non-metallic inclusions experienced the changes from Al2O3 → MgO–Al2O3 → CaO–Al2O3. During the refining process using either of the two ladle lining materials, for all non-metallic inclusions, the vast majority are distributed in the high Al2O3 area of the CaO–Al2O3–MgO phase diagram, with very little or none in the low melting point zone. Non-metallic inclusions are mainly smaller than 3 μm, while those larger than 3 μm consisted primarily of MgO·Al2O3 and CaO–Al2O3 inclusions. The use of an Al2O3–MgO·Al2O3-lining ladle is more effective in reducing the number density of inclusions in the steel.

It is found that the oxygen activity in liquid steel during LF (Ladle Furnace) refining is confirmed to be determined by the equilibrium between dissolved Al and Al2O3 in inclusion. There are two manners for Al2O3 inclusion modification during LF refining: the first route is followed by Al2O3-low modified calcium aluminates-liquid calcium aluminates; and the other is as Al2O3– MgO·Al2O3 spinel-CaO–MgO–Al2O3 multi-component inclusion. In addition, the liquid calcium aluminates have the tendency to be multi-component inclusion. Two types of CaS bearing inclusion could precipitate in a slab during solidification.

From a view point of fracture mechanics, the stress intensity factor range at the front of FGA, ⊿KFGA, was calculated for each specimen by using √area model. Values of ⊿KFGA of both type specimens were almost constant regardless of the stress amplitude at the site of inclusion, and the average value was about 5 MPa√m.

{"title": "Nitrogen and Carbon Isotopic Composition of the Sun Inferred from a High-Temperature Solar Nebular Condensate", "abstract": "We report high-precision measurements of nitrogen and carbon isotopic compositions of a carbon-bearing titanium-nitride (osbornite) in a calcium-aluminum-rich inclusion (CAI) from the CH/CB-like carbonaceous chondrite Isheyevo. The mineralogy and petrography of the CAI and thermodynamic calculations indicate that the osbornite formed by gas-solid condensation in a high-temperature (similar to 2000 K) region of the solar nebula. Because isotopic fractionation at high temperature is small, the measured nitrogen [N-15/N-14 = (2.356 +/- 0.018) x 10(-3)] and carbon [C-13/C-12 = 0.01125 +/- 0.00008; 1 sigma] isotopic compositions of the Isheyevo osbornite are representative of the solar nebula and, hence, of the Sun. This conclusion is supported by the observations that ( 1) the measured C-13/C-12 ratio is indistinguishable from the spectroscopic determination of the C-13/C-12 ratio of the solar photosphere and ( 2) the measured N-15/N-14 ratio of osbornite is in excellent agreement with the Galileo spacecraft measurement of the nitrogen isotopic composition of the Jovian atmosphere, the second largest reservoir of nitrogen in the solar system. The inferred N-15/N-14 ratio of the solar nebula is also similar to the nitrogen isotopic composition of the vast majority of chondritic nanodiamonds, suggesting their solar nebula origin.", "source": "https://openalex.org/W1977118605", "pdf_url": "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/512052/pdf", "year": 2007, "country": "USA", "authors": ["Anders Meibom", "Alexander N.

Since inclusions significantly influence properties and behaviour of materials and at the same time give indications on the quality of the steel, it is quite interesting to precise their nature and their origin. In this paper concerning a project involved in the COST 517 framework, studied alloys are high alloy steels. The raw materials were obtained from the conventionally electrical cast ingot and the Electro Slag Refining processes. The purpose is to compare various inclusions produced by these different processes and their effect on the mechanical properties. The raw material because of the melting processes themselves, leads to a product with a good to a great cleanliness, and tiny inclusions, which are haphazardly distributed. The actual ASTM E45 chart seems to be inappropriate, as the inclusions founded are too small in size. Therefore, we manage to develop a specific procedure for the study of such inclusions.

{"title": "The role of plasma in plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposition of crystalline films", "abstract": "The inclusion of plasma in atomic layer deposition processes generally offers the benefit of substantially reduced growth temperatures and greater flexibility in tailoring the gas-phase chemistry to produce specific film characteristics. The benefits plasmas provide, however, come at the cost of a complex array of process variables that often challenge the ability to predict, a priori, the influence of any one input parameter. In this work, the authors attempt to provide some clarity as to how plasmas are formed and controlled and how they can most optimally be employed within the framework of atomic layer deposition. To begin, the authors cover some of the fundamentals of plasma generation along with the production of energetic and reactive species and their transport within the plasma. They then focus on how different plasma generation schemes and geometries, often employed in plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposition (PEALD), differ in their production of energetic and reactive species. They also address the plasma-surface interactions that are critical for film growth and control of crystallinity. Throughout this work, the authors use both current experimental data and a review of previously published works to describe how variations in the approach to plasma generation and the interactions between plasma-produced species and the growth surface influence the plasma reactant step in PEALD processes. The authors highlight two case studies to demonstrate how these relationships can be used to control the phase purity of crystalline titanium dioxide (TiO2) films and grow crystalline growth of semiconducting indium nitride (InN).", "source": "https://openalex.org/W3027990810", "pdf_url": null, "year": 2020, "country": "USA", "authors": ["David R.

{"title": "The Influence of Trace Elements on the Nature of the Nuclei of the Graphite in Ductile Iron", "abstract": "Nucleation mechanisms and the effect of minor elements added with the inoculants are still a subject of extensive research in ductile iron. Oxides, sulfides, silicates and nitrides have been reported to be nuclei for graphite precipitation. Those compounds originate both from the nodulizing treatment and the inoculation process. Previous research works have shown that titanium nitrides or carbonitrides play an active role in graphite nucleation. In order to determine the efficiency and nature of nitrides that can act as nuclei for graphite, and the possible effect of the trace elements added with the inoculant, melts with titanium contents ranging from 0.007% to 0.036% were produced and poured into standard thermal analysis cups, with and without inoculation. Different inoculants rich in titanium, cerium, aluminum or zirconium were used. Two cups were produced with each inoculant, one cooled down to room temperature, and the other quenched in brine immediately after pouring. Nucleation sites were characterized through detector, spectrum, mapping and line scans of a FEG-SEM equipment. Most of the analyzed nuclei exhibited two or three different inclusions: magnesium sulfides or Mg-Ca oxy-sulfides, Mg or Al oxides, and Ti carbo-nitrides or Mg-Si-Al nitrides. The appearance of each type of nitrides is directly related to the titanium content in the base melt. When titanium was added in the inoculant, no titanium nitrides were noticeable. The zirconium added with the inoculant promoted more complex nitrides that appeared in higher amount. Cerium appears occasionally forming sulfides. Aluminum stimulates the formation of complex nitrides. No differences in the nature of the nuclei were observed between the samples quenched and the ones obtained at room temperature, which assures the methodology approach.", "source": "https://openalex.org/W2810331258", "pdf_url": "https://www.scientific.net/MSF.925.78.pdf", "year": 2018, "country": "ES", "authors": ["G.

{"title": "Large titanium nitride (osbornite) crystals in the metallurgical slag from Kladno steel-works (Czech Republic)", "abstract": "Large crystals of titanium nitride (mineral osbornite) from metallurgical slag were studied by EMPA, XRD and Raman spectroscopy. The sample was collected at metallurgical dump in Kladno in the early 1970s and briefly described by Žáček and Ondruš (2003). The sample has a size of about 40 × 30 × 30 mm and is notable for its high density and conspicuous cubes of copper-like red to gold colour with metallic lustre (Fig. 1–2). The material consists of dominant gehlenite (~ 65% of the sample, all vol. %), osbornite (~ 20%), metallic iron (~ 8%), oldhamite (~ 5%), spinel (~1%) and anorthite (~1%), see Fig 3. All these phases were analyzed with the Cameca SX100 electron microprobe, and osbornite by Raman spectroscopy. Gehlenite and osbornite were also confirmed by XRD (Žáček – Ondruš 2003). Gehlenite contains a low concentration of MgO (0.8–1.1 wt.%) and traces of Na2O (0.06–0.16 wt.%) and Fe2O3 (0.4 wt.%). Aggregates of metallic iron embedded in gehlenite contain low titanium (up to 0.06 wt.% Ti) and elevated phosphorus concentrations (0.53–1.59 wt.% P), whereas tiny iron inclusions embedded in osbornite are richer in titanium (1.31 wt.%) and poorer in P (0.37 wt.%). Oldhamite, a cubic CaS, forms rounded inclusions 20–150 µm in size embedded in massive gehlenite. It is characterized by elevated concentration of Mn (2.7 wt.%) and low Fe (0.3 wt.%) and Mg (0.15 wt.%). Spinel has empirical formula Mg0.98Al1.99O4, and plagioclase is pure anorthite. Compositional data of osbornite are given in Table 1, those of associated minerals in Table 2 and 3. Osbornite forms aggregates of cubic crystals in a small slag cavity. Individual and crystal aggregates, usually up to 5 mm in size, are embedded in massive gehlenite. The largest aggregate of osbornite crystals reaching about 15 × 8 mm in size (Fig. 2). Osbornite contains 76.30–78.21 wt.% Ti, 21.31–23.82 wt.% N, and 0.02–0.46 wt. % Fe and displays stoichiometric composition Ti0.97–1.03N0.96–1.03 with only 0.005 apfu Fe (see Table 1). Lattice parameter is: a = 4.2536(3) A (Žáček – Ondruš 2003). The Raman spectrum of osbornite (Fig. 4) measured on the unpolished surface of cubic crystals showed the following vibrational bands: 1498, 201, 226, 271, 316, 345, 395, 439, 520, 559, 609, 649, 765, 836, and 1075 (all in cm–1). Raman spectra of TiN and other Ti nitrides have been studied by a number of authors (e.g. Spengler et al. 1978, Subramanian et al. 2011, Judek et al. 2021). The spectra can be divided into acoustic (A) and optical (O) part and further to the combination A O, 2A and 2O modes (Spengler et al. 1978; see Fig. 4). In addition to the vibrational bands typical of osbornite (201, 271, 316, 345, 395, 520, 559, 649, 765, 836 and 1075 cm–1), there are also vibrational bands corresponding to rutile and to the TiON phase (149, 226, 395, 439, 520, 609 and 649 cm–1, Spengler et al. 1978, Judek et al. 2021). The position of the vibrational band of osbornite at 201 cm–1 indicates a stoichiometric Ti : N ratio of 1 : 1, which is in agreement with the results of WDS chemical analysis (Spengler et al. 1978). The detected presence of TiON and TiO2 phases on the surface of osbornite crystals indicates oxidation of osbornite, probably at elevated temperatures. A similar effect was achieved during laboratory annealing of TiN layers at temperatures above 250 °C (Glaser et al. 2007) or above 500 °C (Chen et al. 2005). Osbornite had long been considered as an exclusively extraterrestrial mineral (Ramdohr 1973, Casanova 1992), and only a few natural terrestrial localities have been identified so far. It was first detected in heavy mineral concentrates from volcanic breccias at the contact of the Priazov Massif with the Donbas Basin in Ukraine (Tataritsev et al. 1987).", "source": "semanticscholar:3d5171202c37d86597234cccc3c76f7264e7c223", "pdf_url": "", "year": 2024, "country": "Unknown", "authors": ["V.

Presumably, both oxygen from the natural oxide layer and from the residual atmosphere of the vacuum chamber, penetrating into deeper surface layers during irradiation, participate in the oxidation of titanium alloy components.

In this study, NMIs in titanium-deoxidized steels were investigated, complemented with thermodynamic assessment for more accurate phase characterization. The NMIs were analyzed with a Jeol JSM-7900F FESEM-EDS (Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope equipped with Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscope). For automated particle analyses on FESEM, Aztec Feature runs were carried out on polished steel samples, providing the elemental composition, in addition to morphological data, for each observed NMI. Utilizing the obtained EDS analyses, the fractions of oxides (Al 2 O 3 , MnO, TiO x ), manganese sulfide (MnS), and titanium nitride (TiN) in each NMI are estimated with a MATLAB script. Based on the estimated phase contents, a composition-based classification method for the NMIs is presented. To visualize the phase contents of the observed NMIs, the calculated compositions are plotted on MnO – TiO 2 – Ti 2 O 3 ternary diagrams.

{"title": "Optimizing Slag Content to Control Ds-Type Inclusions in 10B21 Cold Heading Steel", "abstract": "Ds-type inclusions during production are an important factor affecting the performance and quality of manufactured 10B21 steel. To minimize Ds-type inclusions in steel and improve the production qualification rate of steelmaking plants, a refining slag system optimization scheme was proposed based on the analysis of current inclusion evolution during the steelmaking process, and industrial tests were conducted to verify improvements resulting from application of the proposed scheme. The results showed that the composition of Ds inclusions in 10B21 steel are mainly CaO–Al2O3–MgO–CaS–TiN, which exists in the form of calcium–magnesium aluminate coated with titanium nitride and calcium sulfide. The main reason for the formation of Ds inclusions is the poor fluidity of the refining slag and its low capability to absorb inclusions. The poor coverage of the refining slag on the molten steel during refining can easily cause secondary oxidation of the molten steel. Thus, the formation and growth of Ds-type inclusions are aggravated after the calcium feeding line and soft blowing operation. Here, we propose to minimize Ds inclusions using our optimized refined slag system. The mass percentage of the optimized slag system is CaO: 55–60%, Al2O3: 20–35%, SiO2: 3–7%, MgO: 4–8%, (MnO + FeO) < 1%, and the basicity is controlled within the range of 7–11. We observed that our optimized refining slag system has a significantly improved ability to remove inclusions, particularly Ds inclusions, which improves the qualification rate of 10B21 steel.", "source": "semanticscholar:caf98e2d3897541b9cc1c00d9d977d4e22d76320", "pdf_url": "https://www.mdpi.com/2075-163X/11/9/1016/pdf?version=1631956563", "year": 2021, "country": "Unknown", "authors": ["Z.

{"title": "Simulation of Steel Refining Process in Converter", "abstract": "Abstract Steel refining is a complex phenomenon which depends on numerous variables, so, a kinetic approach is necessary for precise understanding of the refining process. In this study, based on a previously proposed model for hot metal dephosphorization, a new simulation model for the steel refining process in BOF is presented. In most cases, steelmaking slag is saturated with dicalcium‐silicate (C 2 S) and it is well known that C 2 S forms solid solution with tricalcium‐phosphate (C 3 P) in a wide composition range and the partition ratio of phosphorus between C 2 S and liquid slag is large. On the other hand, C 2 S formed around the lime surface is known as a barrier to lime dissolution into liquid slag. In this simulation model not only the effect of solid phase in slag is considered but also the effects of temperature dependence of variables as well as top and bottom blowing and scrap melting are taken into account. The calculation results are compared with industrial data and the good agreement between experimental and simulation results evidence the validity of this kinetic approach to steel refining process in BOF.

{"title": "A New Approach to Molten Steel Refining Using Fine Gas Bubbles.", "abstract": "A new process has been developed for metal refining. This process involves the creation and dispersion of fine bubbles in molten metals by introducing inert or reactive gas into a turbulent flow region during metal transfer. The highly turbulent metal flow splits the gas into fine bubbles and results in good mixing between the gas and molten metal phases. These conditions are ideal for contacting inclusions in the metal with the bubbles and subsequent flotation of the inclusions to the metal-slag interface where the inclusions are then absorbed by the covering slag layer. Dissolved gases, such as [H], [O], [N], in the metals are also transferred to the gas bubbles and removed from solution. The process can be retrofitted into existing process plants.The process concept has been demonstrated using a full-scale air/water model to simulate the ladle-to-tundish system of continuous casting of steel. At liquid flows typical of those encountered in the caster, fine bubbles smaller than 0.5 mm in diameter can be created and a good mixing between the dispersed gas and the liquid has been achieved.", "source": "https://openalex.org/W2074290480", "pdf_url": "https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/isijinternational1989/36/1/36_1_17/_pdf", "year": 1996, "country": "AU", "authors": ["Laihua Wang", "Hae-Geon Lee", "Peter C.

Since MgO is less stable than CaO and it is easier to be reduced by Al, dissolved Mg is generated earlier and faster than Ca before LF refining, thus the MgO–Al2O3 system inclusions form at first.

{"title": "EAF Stainless Steel Refining - Part I: Observational Study on Chromium Recovery in an Eccentric Bottom Tapping Furnace and a Spout Tapping Furnace", "abstract": "An observational study of the electric arc furnace (EAF) process for austenitic stainless steel was performed. A comparison was made between two distinct EAF types: (1) an eccentric bottom tapping furnace (EBTF) and (2) a spout tapping furnace (STF). In order to study the slag evolution during the EAF process, per heat several slag samples were collected at consecutive process stages. They were subjected to electron probe microanalysis using energy dispersive spectroscopy (EPMA-EDS). Compositional and mineralogical data from 36 heats corroborate that both thermodynamic and kinetic conditions exert a strong influence on the final chromium oxide content of the slag. In the STF, chromium oxide reduction predominantly occurs during tapping, owing to the intimate mixing of steel and slag. A multivariate linear regression analysis reveals that the main parameters determining the overall chromium recovery are the slag basicity and the content of dissolved silicon of the steel. These parameters explain 70% of the observed variance in final chromium oxide levels and can be used as control parameters to improve the chromium recovery. For the EBTF, lower chromium recoveries are recorded due to the absence of sufficient mixing during tapping.", "source": "https://openalex.org/W2521278178", "pdf_url": null, "year": 2007, "country": "BE", "authors": ["Muxing Guo", "Dirk Durinck", "Peter Tom Jones", "G Heylen", "Roel Hendrickx"], "query": "steel refining"}

A soil stabilization method is an effective and practical remediation alternative for arsenic (As) and heavy metal contaminated farmland soils nearby abandoned metal mine in Korea. This method is a technique whereby amendments are incorporated and mixed with a contaminated soil. Toxic metal bind to the amendments, which reduce their mobility in soil, so the successful stabilization of multi-element contaminated soil depends on the combination of critical elements in the soil and the type of amendments. The objective of this study is to investigate the treatment effects and applicability of limestone (LS) and steel refining slag (SRS) as the amendment for farmland soil contaminated with As and heavy metals, and a lab-column test was conducted for achieving this purpose. The result showed that soil treated with LS and SRS maintained pH buffer capacity and, as a result, the heavy metal leaching concentration was quite low below the water quality standard compared to untreated soil which leachate exceeding the water quality standard was observed, however, the arsenic concentration rather increased with increasing mixture ratio of SRS. This was believed to be related to phosphorus (P) contained in SRS, and dominancy in the competitive adsorption relation between As and P binding strongly to iron might be different according to soil characteristic. We suggested that LS is a effective amendment for reducing heavy metals in soil, and SRS should be used after investigating its applicability based on the adsorption selectivity of arsenic and phosphorus in selected soil.", "source": "https://openalex.org/W2082978472", "pdf_url": "http://koreascience.or.kr:80/article/JAKO201120842651458.pdf", "year": 2011, "country": "KR", "authors": ["Sung-Wook Yun", "Sin-Il Kang", "Hae-Geun Jin", "Hajin Kim", "Young-Cheol Lim"], "query": "steel refining"}

The understanding of such reactions can help to prevent the formation of unwanted phases and improve the overall high‐temperature process control.

The coupling of this kinetic model with a multicomponent, multiphase steel–slag reaction interface model leads to an overall model framework to predict the evolution of steel, slag, and inclusion composition. The current work shows the application of the model to simultaneous deoxidation and desulphurization during ladle refining of Si–Mn‐killed steel. The model shows good performance with industrial data. It is demonstrated that for ladle refining practices, silica‐rich slags should be strictly used with basicity (CaO/SiO2) between 1 and 1.2 and with Al2O3 content less than 5 wt%.

Reoxidation presents substantial challenges to process stability and final product quality. Various sources of reoxidation, including exposure to oxidizing gases, reducible oxides in slag and refractories, and the presence of ferroalloys are explored. Fundamental reactions and their consequences, such as changes in steel composition, inclusion composition/morphology, and the formation of reaction products at the interface between liquid steel and refractory materials, are reviewed. High oxygen partial pressure on the refractory side is identified as a significant factor, particularly in tundish and continuous casting processes. To address reoxidation effectively, the review discusses modeling approaches like computational fluid dynamics and thermodynamic/kinetic modeling. In the industrial context, reoxidation in the tundish is mainly attributed to open‐eye formation in the tundish flux and reducible oxides like SiO2 in an insulating cover powder, for example, rice hust ash. Maintaining precise tundish flux control is crucial for steel cleanliness. In conclusion, this review highlights the multifaceted nature of reoxidation challenges in clean steel production.

Furthermore, the change mechanisms of oxide inclusions and the precipitation of calcium sulfide were discussed. The experimental results showed that oxide inclusions were partly changed along with the path of Al2O3→MgO·Al2O3→(MgO·)CaO·Al2O3, which was a little different from the thermodynamic calculation results due to the limited kinetic conditions. Calcium treatment somehow modified the inclusions, however, many large inclusions were generated, and the modification effect would be dramatically decreased by the formation of large amount of CaS inclusions, which appeared with three main distribution forms. The formation of inclusions after calcium treatment were discussed based on the thermodynamic analysis.

The expansion test on the soil-LFS mixtures revealed slight swelling, attributable to the pozzolanic reactions of clay minerals with portlandite and brucite in addition to accommodation within the soil-slag pore structure. The cation exchange capacity of clay minerals affects the interaction between soil and LFS; minerals such as montmorillonite, with a high cation exchange capacity, improve the California bearing ratio and reduce the potential expansion.

The recycling of these residues in the civil construction sector is growing, since both industries have developed an increasing concern for the exhaustion of natural resources. In this scenario, one example is the ladle furnace slag (LFS), a by-product of the secondary refining of steel. It is mainly composed of calcium and calcium magnesium silicates. Thus, this research aims to develop a sustainable binder obtained from LFS as a substitution of hydraulic lime. In this sense, an extensive characterization of the LFS was carried out in its raw and processed forms. Subsequently, all the requirements for hydrated lime and hydraulic lime were verified according to Brazilian and Portuguese standards. Finally, mortars for coating and laying were produced with portland cement, lime, and the sustainable binder, and their main properties were evaluated in the fresh and hardened states. The chemical and mechanical properties of the sustainable binder were closer to those of the hydraulic limes.

The ladle furnace (LF) is a key unit for achieving the above objectives during secondary steelmaking. Proper control of process parameters during LF processing of liquid steel is essential. The paper reports development of a model based advisory system, called ladle furnace on-line reckoner (LFOR), for the prediction and control of temperature and composition of steel in a LF. The thermal and chemistry models employed in the LFOR system are based on simplified physics, material and heat balance, and statistical analysis of plant data. The LFOR system is provided with graphical user interface (GUI) to display the predicted composition and temperature profile. The control advice displayed on the screen provides guidance for arcing and addition to achieve the target temperature and composition. The LFOR system has been commissioned at LF No. 2 of the LD2 and Slab Caster Shop of Tata Steel, Jamshedpur and is designed to meet the requirements of sequence casting as well as to optimise the energy input and cost of alloying additions.

{"title": "Laboratory Evaluation of Ladle Furnace Slag in Unbound Pavement-Base/Subbase Applications", "abstract": "Steel is an inherently never-ending product, in terms of recycling and reuse. The steelmaking process creates an industrial by-product termed as slag. Ladle furnace slag (LFS) is produced at the final stages of the steelmaking process in ladle refining furnaces. The potential use of LFS as a base/subbase material requires a thorough knowledge of its engineering properties. In this research, an extensive suite of engineering characterization tests were carried out to evaluate the engineering properties of LFS. The effect of curing on the strength of unbound LFS was investigated using unconfined compression strength (UCS) and resilient modulus tests. The results showed that the UCS of unbound LFS increased by almost four times with 7 days of curing in a temperature-controlled and moisture-controlled chamber. The resilient modulus value of unbound LFS increased when increasing either confining pressure or deviator stress. The specimens with 7 and 28 days of curing had higher resilient modulus values than uncured samples, which were substantiated by UCS test results. The curing period was found to play an important role in the UCS development of unbound LFS samples, which was attributed to the relatively high lime content of the material. The chemical composition and microstructure of LFS samples were evaluated using X-ray fluorescence (XRF) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analyses. In terms of usage in pavement-base/subbases, the engineering properties of LFS were found to be equivalent or even superior to typical quarry materials.", "source": "https://openalex.org/W2508404401", "pdf_url": null, "year": 2016, "country": "AU", "authors": ["Farshid Maghool", "Arul Arulrajah", "Suksun Horpibulsuk", "Yan‐Jun Du"], "query": "ladle furnace"}

{"title": "Potential Reuse of Ladle Furnace Slag as Cementitious Material: A Literature Review of Generation, Characterization, and Processing Methods", "abstract": "Ladle furnace slag (LFS), a by-product of steel refining, shows a promising reuse pathway as an alternative additive or substitute for Portland cement due to its high alkalinity and similar chemical composition to clinkers. However, LFS is often stored in large, open surface areas, leading to many environmental issues. To tackle waste management challenges, LFS can be recycled as supplementary cementitious material (SCM) in many cementitious composites. However, LFS contains some mineral phases that hinder its reactivity (dicalcium silicate (γ-C2S)) and pose long-term durability issues in the cured cemented final product (free lime (f-CaO) and free magnesia (f-MgO)). Therefore, LFS needs to be adequately treated to enhance its reactivity and ensure long-term durability in the structures of the cementitious materials. This literature review assesses possible LFS treatments to enhance its suitability for valorization. Traditional reviews are often multidisciplinary and explore all types of iron and steel slags, sometimes including the recycling of LFS in the steel industry. As the reuse of industrial by-products requires a knowledge of their characteristics, this paper focuses first on LFS characterization, then on the obstacles to its use, and finally compiles an exhaustive inventory of previously investigated treatments. The main parameters for treatment evaluation are the mineralogical composition of treated LFS and the unconfined compressive strength (UCS) of the final geo-composite in the short and long term. This review indicates that the treatment of LFS using rapid air/water quenching at the end-of-refining process is most appropriate, allowing a nearly amorphous slag to be obtained, which is therefore suitable for use as a SCM. Moreover, the open-air watering treatment leads to an optimal content of treated LFS. Recycling LFS in this manner can reduce OPC consumption, solve the problem of limited availability of blast furnace slag (GGBFS) by partially replacing this material, conserve natural resources, and reduce the carbon footprint of cementitious material operations.", "source": "semanticscholar:0a9b4db1bdb8379d3e077c37fb0c60341fa6e802", "pdf_url": "", "year": 2024, "country": "Unknown", "authors": ["Noureddine Ouffa", "Mostafa Benzaazoua", "R.

A design of experiments (DoE) methodology was employed to systematically generate distinct mixtures for each soil sample, utilizing a simplex-centroid design. The mixtures were subjected to unconfined compressive strength (UCS), California Bearing Ratio (CBR) and resilient modulus (RM) tests. The industrial by-products improved the mechanical properties of the soils, providing UCS, CBR index and RM increases up to 130.5%, 324.4% and 132.6%, respectively.

However, despite this blend having already been evaluated in alkali-activated mixtures, knowledge about this mixture in situations of direct replacement of OPC by slag is still lacking. This study evaluates the synergistic effects of combining LFS and MK in cementitious mortars. Due to an insufficient hydration reaction observed in the short term, this study focuses on assessing the long-term performance of these mortars. Both the fresh and hardened states at 28 and 180 days are evaluated, and the resulting microstructural characteristics and constituent phases are also examined. After 180 days of curing, the mortar with MK exhibits superior binding activity compared to the results at 28 days. Although the nominal resistance does not show a clear advantage with the application of MK, a significant reduction in the porosity of the mortar is observed. Microstructural analysis indicates that the addition of MK increases the hydration compounds when mixed with LFS. Importantly, the sample containing MK and LFS showed a 42% reduction in cement consumption, highlighting the potential for resource efficiency.

It is necessary to conduct in-depth research on this process using scientific methods and explore the impact of scrap steel addition on other materials. A comprehensive calculation model was established by scientifically investigating material and thermal balances in the LF process in this article, and the impact of initial steel and scrap compositions, temperature, mass and price of scrap on production costs were analysed and compared based on the model. The results showed that as the carbon and silicon content in the initial steel increase by every 0.01% could on average reduce the production cost per ton of steel by 4.013 CNY and 0.8473 CNY, respectively, and increases by 0.123 CNY as the sulphur content increase every 0.001%. The impact of scrap composition on costs is similar to that of the initial molten steel. Increasing the carbon and sulphur content in scrap by every 0.01% will on average increase costs by 0.0765 CNY and 0.01 CNY, respectively.

Additionally, experiments with different argon flow rates (300, 400, and 500 NL min−1) during the power supply stages of multifurnace argon tests of AB/A steel show improvements in desulfurization rate, heating rate, processing time, and power consumption per ton of steel heated by 1 °C and power consumption per ton of steel per second.", "source": "semanticscholar:cc57e44c1eb0847bd35b31b7940ac117291a8752", "pdf_url": "", "year": 2024, "country": "Unknown", "authors": ["Jian Song", "Jiongming Zhang", "Yanbin Yin"], "query": "ladle furnace"}
{"title": "Strength performance of low-bearing-capacity clayey soils stabilized with ladle furnace slag", "abstract": "In this paper, the performance of ladle furnace slag (LFS), a by-product of secondary steel refining, is evaluated as a binder to stabilize clayey soils of low bearing capacity. The aim is to define whether additions of this by-product to clayey soil can stabilize the soil in accordance with the technical specifications of Spanish standards. To do so, three different soils stabilized with 5% LFS were compared with the same soils stabilized with 2% lime and with no stabilization, in order to investigate their different behaviors. The chemical and mineralogical characterizations of all the soil mixes were conducted using X-ray fluorescence, X-ray diffraction, and scanning electron microscopy. The Atterberg limit test was used to study the plastic behavior of the soils, and the results of compaction, bearing capacity, unconfined compressive strength, and direct shear strength (cohesion and friction angle) tests defined their strength characteristics. The analysis was completed with the pH monitoring of the mixes along the curing time in order to relate the pH changes with the strength evolution. The addition of LFS to the soils has resulted in an increase in the liquid limit and plastic limit, causing therefore a slight decrease in the plasticity index. All the soils showed increases between 30% and 70% in their California Bearing Ratios immediately after mixing with 5% LFS, and after 90 days of curing, improvements of 30–188% in their unconfined compressive strength were noted in comparison with untreated soil, which were higher than the lime-stabilized soils. The cohesion of soils stabilized with LFS at 28 days of curing obtained improvements ranging from 40 to 300% depending on the type of soil. However, the friction angle showed a slight increase of 10% in two of the soils and zero in another. The high initial pH in LFS-stabilized soils was maintained during the curing time, which favored the development of pozzolanic reactions that improve the soil strength. These results confirmed that the substitution of lime with LFS is a feasible option for soil stabilization.", "source": "semanticscholar:065ecc54c56e18accb94601360b519f872854aee", "pdf_url": "https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11356-023-29375-y.pdf", "year": 2023, "country": "Unknown", "authors": ["A.

{"title": "Analyzing the Relationship between Compressive Strength and Modulus of Elasticity in Concrete with Ladle Furnace Slag", "abstract": "The addition of Ladle Furnace Slag (LFS) to concrete modifies its compressive strength and modulus of elasticity and consequently impacts their relationship. This research evaluated both properties at 28, 90, and 180 days in concrete mixes produced with 5%, 10%, and 20% of two LFS types, both stabilized and non-stabilized. The relationship between them was then analyzed through these experimental results by adopting a statistical approach. A three-way analysis of variance revealed that both properties were affected by LFS differently. Thus, the effect of each LFS content on both features varied depending on its composition and pre-treatment. Furthermore, the effect of the LFS content on the compressive strength was also influenced by the age of the concrete. These facets implied that when analyzing the relationship between both mechanical properties, the monotonic correlations were stronger than the linear ones, reaching values between 0.90 and 1.00. Therefore, the double reciprocal regression models were the most precise ones for expressing the modulus of elasticity as a function of compressive strength. The model accuracy was further enhanced when discriminating based on the LFS type and introducing concrete age as a predictive variable. With all these considerations, the average deviations between the estimated and experimental values of 1–3% and the maximum deviations of 4–7% were reached, as well as R2 coefficients of up to 97%. These aspects are central to the further development of LFS concrete models.", "source": "semanticscholar:f3d17898b8113e816ce20b753b7a3442ffdd447e", "pdf_url": "https://www.mdpi.com/2075-5309/13/12/3100/pdf?version=1702482800", "year": 2023, "country": "Unknown", "authors": ["V.

{"title": "Ladle Furnace Slag: Synthesis, Properties, and Applications", "abstract": "Ladle slag is a byproduct formed during the ladle refining stage of steel making. It is a dusty material that has been considered industrial waste. Technical advancements towards a sustainable industry led to the development of different applications for ladle slag. Depending on the processing methods during the steel slag production and the weathering of the slag post‐production, the elemental composition of the steel slag largely varies. Owing to this, its characteristics cannot be generalized and specific applications depending on the sources are developed. It is generally used in construction materials, soil rejuvenation, and CO2 capture. This paper reviews the production process, the mineralogical and morphological properties, stabilization techniques, and the applications of ladle furnace (LF) slag. One of the prime focuses of waste remediation and sustainable industry is to find meaningful ways to turn waste into products. In this respect, a comprehensive review of the properties of LF slag and its current application will help provide a framework for the development of future sustainability goals.

The effect of the synthesis conditions on the crystalline phases of the zeolite molecular sieves was investigated by XRD. The results showed that the best zeolite molecular sieves were prepared with an LFS: FA ratio of 4: 6, a curing temperature of 40 °C, a curing time of 12 h, a sodium silicate modulus (Ms) of 1.4, a NaOH concentration of 4 mol/L, a hydrothermal temperature of 120 °C, and a hydrothermal time of 12 h. On this basis, the products were analyzed by SEM, N_2 adsorption, and FT-IR. The results showed that the synthesized zeolite molecular sieves had mesoporous properties, and the degree of polymerization and cross-linking of the silica-aluminate gel were enhanced after hydrothermal treatment. In addition, the formation mechanism of the zeolite molecular sieves was explored through the changes of the silica-alumina during zeolite formation.

The species transport equation is solved to analyze the kinetic behavior and chemical content variation in the melt. The sulfur distribution ratio is calculated based on the slag sulfide capacity and oxygen activity. Subsequently, the solutions are coupled by introducing the species transfer and source terms generated by comparing the initial and predicted thermodynamic equilibrium states at the steel–slag interface cell. The model is validated by experimentally comparing the sulfur content. Furthermore, the model is applied under different kinetics and thermodynamics conditions. With an increase in the gas flow rate, the in‐phase effective diffusion coefficient increases, but the number of interface cells involved in the sulfur transfer process decreases. The complex relationship between the desulfurization process and the gas flow rate results from the mutual antagonism between these two factors. Moreover, the study findings demonstrate that a higher slag basicity enhances the calculated sulfur distribution ratio and final desulfurization ratio.", "source": "semanticscholar:407265c08e4d7610fbcb53e51ead2f747571039c", "pdf_url": "", "year": 2023, "country": "Unknown", "authors": ["Bingchang He", "Zicheng Xin", "Jiangshan Zhang"], "query": "ladle furnace"}
{"title": "Projection-based model order reduction for residence time distribution analysis of an industrial-scale continuous casting tundish", "abstract": "The flow behavior in the continuous casting tundish plays a critical role in steel quality and is typically characterized via residence time distribution (RTD) curves. This study investigates the fluid flow behaviour in a single-strand tundish using numerical and experimental approaches. Full-order model (FOM) steady-state simulations were conducted under both isothermal and non-isothermal conditions to assess the influence of thermal buoyancy on the flow characteristics. The results show that buoyancy effects under non-isothermal conditions have a negligible impact on the overall velocity field. The converged flow fields serve as initial conditions for transient tracer transport simulations, enabling evaluation of RTD curves and volume partitioning. A Galerkin projection-based reduced-order model (ROM) is developed to efficiently derive RTD curves. Comparison of RTD curves from experiments, FOM simulations, and ROM predictions demonstrates strong agreement, with both computational approaches closely matching experimental data. A parameter-time dependent ROM is subsequently developed using Galerkin projection and operator interpolation. This enables efficient evaluation of RTD curves across varying parameter values with significantly reduced computational cost compared to full-order simulations. The ROM framework is well-suited for real-time analysis, design processes, optimization, and digital twin applications in metallurgical processes.", "source": "arxiv:2509.20366v1", "pdf_url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.20366v1.pdf", "year": 2025, "country": "Unknown", "authors": ["Harshith Gowrachari", "Mattia Giuseppe Barra", "Moaad Khamlich", "Giovanni Stabile", "Gianluca Bazzaro"], "query": "tundish"}
{"title": "Reservoir computing based predictive reduced order model for steel grade intermixing in an industrial continuous casting tundish", "abstract": "Continuous casting is a widely adopted process in the steel industry, where maintaining high steel quality is paramount. Efficient prediction of grade intermixing during ladle changeover operations is critical for maintaining steel quality and minimizing material losses in the continuous casting process. Among various factors influencing grade intermixing, operating parameters play a significant role, in addition to tundish geometry and flow control devices. In this study, three-dimensional, transient, two-phase turbulent flow simulations are conducted to investigate the ladle changeover operation. During this process, the molten steel level in the tundish typically varies over time, significantly affecting the grade intermixing phenomena. The influence of ladle change time on intermixing time has been presented. However, high-fidelity full-order simulations of such complex transient phenomena are computationally expensive and are impractical for real-time monitoring or design-space exploration in industrial-scale applications. To address this issue, a reduced order modelling approach based on proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) and reservoir computing (RC) is employed to efficiently predict intermixing time. The proposed reduced order model (ROM) demonstrates excellent predictive accuracy using limited training data while requiring significantly less computational resources and training time.

Towards these goals, numerous physical and mathematical modelling studies embodying both industrial and water model tundishes have been carried out and reported in the literature. Based on an extensive literature search, we now present a summary, discussion and analysis of these. For the sake of convenience and clarity of presentation, the studies have been categorised into three major groups: (1) physical modelling (2) mathematical modelling and (3) combined physical and mathematical modelling. In each of these categories, a great number of publications on various aspects of tundish metallurgy, such as, modelling criteria, turbulent fluid flow, residence time distributions (RTD), inclusion transport and separation, heat loss and temperature drop, grade transition and intermixing, etc. have been reported. These works have lead to considerable improvements in our understanding of the various transport processes (viz, RTD, inclusion float out, thermal energy transport, etc.) associated with tundish operations.

In this work a theoretical study of the separation of solid inclusions, alumina and others, at the steel-slag interface applied to the actual conditions in the tundish has been carried out. The theoretical model is based on the equation of motion with the following forces acting on an inclusion as it tries to cross the interface between the metal and the slag; buoyant, added mass, rebound and drag force. A sensitivity analysis study was carried out in order to clarify which of the parameters in the model that had the largest influence on the inclusion displacement. The results showed that the interfacial tensions (σMI, σIS, σMS) and the slag viscosity (μS) have the largest influence on the predicted displacement. It was also concluded that the overall wettability should be positive and that the slag viscosity should be as low as possible to obtain the most favorable conditions for inclusion transfer at the steel-slag interface.", "source": "https://openalex.org/W1989450251", "pdf_url": "https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/isijinternational/45/11/45_11_1597/_pdf", "year": 2005, "country": "Unknown", "authors": ["Jenny Strandh", "K.

Two independent overviews, published, respectively, in 1999 and 2010, summarize a large number of research work reported by various groups of investigators.

{"title": "Modeling of Fluid Flow and Residence Time Distribution in a Four-strand Tundish for Enhancing Inclusion Removal", "abstract": "The introduction of the appropriate size and precise location of flow control devices such as dam, turbulence inhibitor, etc., helps to modify the flow pattern and minimizing short circuiting and dead zone. Beside this, these also create the surface directed flow and maximize the residence time available for the flotation of inclusions and assimilation of the reaction products from the molten steel into the slag phase. These can be products of deoxidation, reoxidation, precipitation, emulsification and/or entrainment of refractory components into the melt and thus encompass both indigenous and exogenous inclusions. To this end, both the numerical and physical simulations were carried out mainly for three cases: a) in absence of flow control devices (i.e., bare tundish), b) in the presence of a dam, and c) with the application of turbulence inhibiting device (TID) and dam combination in the existing tundish configuration. The commercial CFD (computational fluid dynamics) package FLUENT® was used to predict the flow field prevalent in the water model tundish at steady state, whereas in the experimental program, both Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) techniques for flow measurements and tracer dispersion experiments for concentration measurements were applied in the present study. Among all types of configurations applied in the present study, a combination of TID with holes+a dam work reasonably found to be an optimum configuration of the four-strand tundish regarding inclusion floatation.

{"title": "Numerical and Physical Simulation of Tundish Fluid Flow Phenomena", "abstract": "The fluid flow in a continuous casting tundish is numerically and physically simulated by means of water models. Results of residence time distribution (RTD) measurements and laser-optical measurements (Laser Doppler Anemometry – LDA, Digital Particle Image Velocimetry-DPIV) are used to validate the numerical results for water before the numerical simulation is transferred to the steel melt. The investigations are focused on both steady-state and transient casting conditions. To reduce vortexing and turbulence in the tundish different types of turbo-stoppers are installed in the water models and their influence on the spacious flow structure is discussed. The turbo-stopper produces higher turbulence in the inlet region of the tundish, but this region is spatially more limited in relation to the flow without turbo-stopper. Thereby a more homogeneous flow is created at the outlet of the tundish with better conditions for particle separation. Basic design criteria for the geometry of a turbo-stopper are developed. Moreover, the processes of first tundish filling and ladle change are simulated at a downscaled water model and these results are compared with numerical simulations using a Volume of Fluid (VoF) model.

{"title": "Hydrodynamic performance of steelmaking tundish systems: a comparative study of three different tundish designs", "abstract": "Extensive water modelling was carried out to ascertain the influence of various types of baffle designs on the hydrodynamic performance of three different designs of steelmaking tundish systems. These included, a two-strand slab casting tundish, a six-strand billet casting tundish and a five-strand, skewed, delta shaped tundish. Plant scale operating conditions were scaled down respecting both geometric and Froude similarity and on the basis of the latter, the inflow rate of water into the model tundish systems was estimated via: Qm = Λ5/2Qf.s. To quantify the hydrodynamic performance, residence time distribution (RTD) characteristics were measured using the conductivity measurement technique for a wide range of baffle designs. From such measurements as well as from flow visualisation studies, the following general observations have been made. The optimum design of baffles together with its number and position within the tundish appear to be a strong function of the basic tundish design (viz., the geometry, the number of operating strands etc.). Of the various types of baffles investigated in this work (dam, dam + weir, baffles with holes etc.), appropriately designed slotted baffles appear to modify the RTD characteristics most favourably towards superior metallurgical performances. Increase in the number of strands, asymmetricity in the tundish design and flawed operating conditions, (viz., large width to length ratio) were all found to influence the tundish performance adversely. A comparison of experimental results for the three tundish systems indicated that changing the characteristics of the baffle design can lead to significant performance improvement in the case of the two symmetric tundish systems (e.g., the two and the six strand tundishes), the five strand skewed, delta shaped tundish was, however, found to be somewhat insensitive to such changes. For such a tundish geometry, no design of the flow-modification devices tried, could bring the hydrodynamic performance any closer to the best results obtained for the two other tundish systems. Possible reasons for such observations are discussed in the text. Umfangreiche Wassermodellstudien sollten den Einfluß verschiedener Leitbleche auf die Hydrodynamik dreier verschiedener Tundishbauarten klären. Zur Diskussion standen je ein Gießverteiler einer 2-adrigen Brammen- und einer 6-adrigen Knüppelstrangießanlage als auch ein abgeschrägter, dreieckiger Tundish einer 5-adrigen Anlage. Die Betriebsbedingungen wurden unter Berücksichtigung der geometrischen Verhältnisse und der Froude-Zahl auf den Modellmaßstab übertragen. Auf dieser Basis ließ sich die Wassereintrittsgeschwindikeit in die Modelltundishsysteme mit der Gleichung Qm = Λ5/2Qf.S berechnen. Anhand von Leitfähigkeitsmessungen ließen sich die Merkmale der Verweilzeitverteilungen (RTD) bestimmen. Auf diese Art konnte die hydrodynamische Leistung quantifiziert werden. Bei diesen Messungen als auch bei Fließvisualisierungsstudien konnten eine Reihe von grundlegenden Zusammenhängen beobachtet werden. Die optimale Bauart, Anzahl und Position von Leitblechen im Tundish hängt offensichtlich stark vom grundlegenden Tundishdesign ab (Abmessungen, Anzahl der betriebenen Adern, etc.). Von allen hier untersuchten Leitblechen (Damm, Damm und Wehr, Lochplatten, etc.) scheinen geeignet entworfene, geschlitzte Bleche die RTD-Merkmale im Sinne einer besseren metallurgischen Leistung günstig zu verändern. Gegenteilig wirken eine Erhöhung der Stranganzahl, Asymmetrien in der Tundishauslegung und ungünstige Betriebsbedingungen. Ein Vergleich der Versuchsergebnisse für drei Tundishsysteme zeigt, daß Veränderungen der Charakteristika der Leitblechauslegung bei den beiden symmetrischen Gießverteilersystemen (z.B. beim 2- und 6-adrigen Tundish) zu einer bemerkenswerten Leistungsverbesserung führen können.

The liquid steel flow velocity fields in the former tundish and the optimal one with a turbulence inhibitor and newly-designed baffles were numerically calculated and the flow characteristics in the two cases and other tundish configurations were measured in the physical modeling. The results in the physical modeling experiments showed that large difference in the Residence Time Distribution (RTD) curves of two outlets in one side of the former configuration tundish existed. It was found from the numerical calculation of the velocity fields in the tundishes that with the former tundish configuration velocities and turbulent degree of the liquid steel flow in the impact zone of the tundish were large due to the high velocities of liquid steel from the long shroud of the ladle, which caused in lining corrosion and slag entrapment due to the surface eddies. Asymmetric velocity field in the tundish with the former baffles formed and short circuit flow existed in one side of the four-strand tundish. For the optimal configuration of the tundish with a turbulence inhibitor and newly-designed baffles, very similar RTD curves of the two outlets in the same side of the tundish were achieved. The velocities and turbulent degree in the impacting zone of the tundish were depressed and quiet and symmetric molten steel flow was obtained. Eddies on surface and short circuit flow in the optimal tundish disappeared. Such improvement of liquid steel flow in the tundish would increase the ability of inclusion removal.

Three cases were considered: A bare tundish, a tundish equipped with a pair of weirs and a pair of baffles (arrangement W&B) and a tundish equipped with a turbulence inhibitor and a pair of baffles (arrangement TI&B). The water modeling, under isothermal conditions, indicated the existence of a strong bypass-flow for the bare tundish and the W&B arrangement while the TI&B arrangement reported a longer minimum residence time and higher plug flow characteristics. Numerical results verified the trend mentioned with the water model. The numerical study showed also that cold and hot steel affected considerably the flow patterns of steel due to the existence of buoyancy forces. In the case of a step-input of cold steel, bypass-flow was intensified for the bare tundish and the tundish with a W&B arrangement. When a step input of hot steel is introduced into the system buoyancy forces make the steel to flow preferentially near the free surface.

For economic reasons, only the variants with different baffles configurations were considered. It was also dictated by the simplicity of construction and the possibility of its implementation by the base operating steel mill. In the current study, industrial plant measurements and mathematical modeling were used. Industrial experimental data were used to diagnose the current state of the industrial tundish and then validate the numerical simulations. After this, the influence of different baffle configurations installed in the tundish on the steel flow characteristic was modeled mathematically. Residence time distribution (RTD) curves are plotted, and individual flow shares for the investigated tundish were estimated based on the curves. Finally, the industrial plant was rebuilt according to the numerical results and additional plant measurements were performed. A result of the appearance of the baffles in the tundish working space was the reduction of the transient zone extent. The results indicate the increasing share of the dispersed plug flow and a decreasing share of the dead volume flow, with a practically unchanging share of well-mixed volume flow in the modified tundish.", "source": "https://openalex.org/W2068058725", "pdf_url": "https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11663-012-9662-2.pdf", "year": 2012, "country": "PL", "authors": ["T.

The solution of the species continuity equation predicts the time evolution of the concentration of a tracer at the outlet of the tundish. The numerical prediction of the tracer concentration has been made with nine different turbulence models and has been compared with the experimental observation for the tundish. It has been found that the prediction from the standard k‐ε model, the k‐ε Chen‐Kim (ck) and the standard k‐ε with Yap correction (k‐ε Yap), matches well with that of the experiment compared to the other turbulence models as far as gross quantities like the mean residence time and the ratio of mixed to dead volume are concerned. It has been found that the initial transient development of the tracer concentration is best predicted by the low Reynolds number Lam‐Bremhorst model (LB model) and then by the k‐ε RNG model, while these two models under predict the mean residence time as well as the ratio of mixed to dead volume. The Chen‐Kim low Reynolds number (CK low Re) model (with and without Yap correction) as well as the constant effective viscosity model over predict the mixing parameters, i.e. the mean residence time and the ratio of mixed to dead volume. Taking the solution of the k‐ε model as a starting guess for the large eddy simulation (LES), a solution for the LES could be arrived after adopting a local refinement of the cells twice so that the near wall y + could be set lower than 1. Such a refined grid gave a time‐independent solution for the LES which was used to solve the species continuity equation. The LES solution slightly over predicted the mean residence time but could predict fairly well the mixed volume.

Four major aspects were observed at the steel/refractory interface: steel infiltration into the tundish refractory lining, mainly in the gunning materials; a steel oxidised layer formed at the steel/refractory lining interface; formation of a spinel layer between steel and tundish working refractory lining; and many particles were found in the steel phase, near to the steel/refractory interface, being a potential source of non-metallic inclusions.", "source": "https://openalex.org/W2027639705", "pdf_url": null, "year": 2012, "country": "BR", "authors": ["Mário César Mantovani", "Lisandra Rocha de Moraes", "Robson Leandro da Silva", "EDL Cabral", "E A Possente"], "query": "tundish"}

Since non-metallic inclusions are the main cause of steel plate defects, the reduction of inclusion quantity is a very important problem for steelmaking. In particular, the cleanliness of molten steel in a tundish plays a crucial part in improving the quality of steel plate as well as in preventing immersion nozzle clogging. The tundish includes the functions of flotation and removal of inclusions, though, some contamination to the molten steel also occurs in the tundish. Therefore, it is necessary to make clear the cause of each pollutant and its level in order to produce super clean steels.In this study, the contamination causes of molten steel in the tundish and their influences were analyzed by continual metal sampling during operation with respect to the size, number and composition of the inclusions.The results are as follows:(1) Air oxidation of molten steel is the biggest factor of contamination.(2) The influence of air oxidation decreases and the pollutions of slag increases during continuous operations.", "source": "https://openalex.org/W2130936222", "pdf_url": "https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/isijinternational1989/33/12/33_12_1238/_pdf", "year": 1993, "country": "Japan", "authors": ["Hirohisa Tanaka", "Ryoji Nishihara", "Iturou Kitagawa", "Ryoji Tsujino"], "query": "tundish"}

Existing technologies have been improved and new technologies are being introduced all along the process route to minimise the size and quantity of inclusions. In continuous casting, the function of tundish has changed from its early role as a liquid steel buffer to a multifunctional vessel, dominating quality adjustments, specifically inclusion flotation. To meet stringent cleanliness requirements, a methodology of forced flotation of inclusions by controlled bubbling of inert gas in tundish was developed and investigated. Location of the bubbling arrangement was optimised using the flow profile generated by water modelling experiments. Optimum gas flowrates were calculated mathematically and further adjusted with a series of experiments. Extensive plant scale trials were used to optimise the process parameters and bring the technology to practice. There was a 33–70% reduction in inclusions of size greater than 50 μm and a 13–36% reduction in inclusions 25–50 μm. Inclusion removal reduced at higher casting speeds. Under steady state conditions, efficiency of inclusion flotation was found to be a function of casting speed.

A simple mathematical model of inclusion removal by gas bubbling in a tundish has been developed. It was found that maintaining bubble size in the range of 0.5 to 3 mm should enhance inclusion removal efficiency. Increasing the bubbly volume fraction in the tundish and the tundish residence time can be used to improve the inclusion removal efficiency by gas bubbling. However, the formation of small bubbles in a tundish may be problematic as bubble size is affected by the high wetting angles typical of liquid metal contact with bubble orifice materials.On a analysé la probabilité de l'enlèvement d'inclusions de l'acier liquide par collision et attachement à des bulles ascendantes de gaz.

R. China) is used as the base material to develop fluoride-free (F-free) mold powders to improve the heat transfer between the mold and the strand. Effects of the binary basicity (CaO/SiO2), TiO2, Na2O, Li2O, MgO, MnO and B2O3 on the melting temperature, viscosity and heat flux of F-free mold powders are investigated. The laboratory results indicate that 1) the melting temperature and the viscosity of the F-free powder decrease, as expected, with increasing the content of Li2O, B2O3 and Na2O respectively, but the lowest viscosity is achieved with 6.0 mass% TiO2; 2) the heat flux of the F-free slag film with 1.0–6.0 mass% TiO2 is close to that of a conventional mold slag film with 2.0–10.0 mass% F; 3) the effect of basicity of the F-free powder on the heat flux is the same as the powder bearing fluoride; 4) the heat flux changes significantly with more than 8.0 mass% Na2O and about 4.0 mass% MnO, whereas the effects of Li2O and B2O3 in the F-free powder on heat flux are not significant. The suitable range of main components of the F-free powder with TiO2 is proposed for casting peritectic-grade-steel slabs.

Film sampling was carried out in the tail-out phase at the end of the cast. The films were subjected to chemical analyses and respective compounds and phases were distinguished. Local heat fluxes were measured with thermocouples and the resulting data was subjected to analyses.\\n\\nNo previous study utilising equivalent sampling and analysis has been reported. Several massive samples were collected, a number of which were several millimetres in thickness and covered virtually the entire width of the mould, descending 40cm below the meniscus. Analysis showed that the flux films could explain some of the very low, local heat fluxes that were observed.\\n\\nThe most typical feature in the sampled films was the layer dominated by a cuspidine phase. The crystalline structure of these films had either formed during solidification, or via the devitrification process. Following a high cooling rate and short residence time prior to sampling, glassy structures were found. Most of these findings accord well with the literature. Such crystalline structures are to be expected in these conditions, via either direct formation or devitrification. Evidence from the literature confirms that the layers in the films were formed during the longer period of the casting process and not during tail-out.\\n\\nThe most unexpected feature was the formation of a separate NaF layer, and the formation of elemental sodium (Na), and probably sometimes potassium (K), against the mould wall. The study found that the films can have residence times of as much as several hours on the mould wall, and complex structures containing several sub layers, voids and pores can develop.

The optimum formulation for tape casting is affected substantially by decreasing particle size. For example, the amount of dispersant needed is increased. Moreover, the amount of plasticizer/binder must be increased so as to maintain the solids content in the dried tapes below a critical level (about 55 vol% in this case), which decreases with particle size. Rheological studies on the effectiveness of menhaden fish oil and phosphate ester as dispersants show that phosphate ester can be used in lower concentrations, for the preparation of higher solids loading slurries, and was therefore selected for further study. The amount of dispersant required to obtain minimum slurry viscosity was found to be primarily dependent upon the effective particle surface area, defined as that available to the dispersant molecules. In the case of particles composed of agglomerated crystallites (such as the ZrO 2 , powder used here), this may be considerably less than that measured by nitrogen absorption. Moreover, the porous internal structure of such powders is filled with solvent, which increases the effective solids loading of the slurry, and thus its viscosity.

To clarify the change of the surface texture by crystallization, the surface of powder plate was observed with a laser microscope.

Accordingly, a model system consisting of steel shell/mold flux film/copper mold is built to simulate the heat transfer near the meniscus in the mold for continuous casting, and the thermal resistance is determined by measuring temperature gradient in the copper mold in the simulator. The interfacial thermal resistance increases with increasing flux film thickness in contrast to previous observation by others who assumed that the interfacial thermal resistance is constant for different flux film thickness. The interfacial thermal resistance is found to be about 50% of overall thermal resistance for the heat transfer.

The heat transfer reduction based on this finding would be possible according to the following mechanism: Crystallization of mold flux film increases the reflectivity of the crystalline slag layer in the film owing to enhanced scattering of light by introduction of crystal grain boundaries, and thereby more radiation energy returns from the crystalline slag layer to the steel, leading to reduction in the total heat flux across the film.", "source": "https://openalex.org/W2034714353", "pdf_url": "https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/isijinternational/48/4/48_4_446/_pdf", "year": 2008, "country": "Japan", "authors": ["Hideko Nakada", "Masahiro Susa", "Yusuke Seko", "Miyuki Hayashi", "Kazuhiro Nagata"], "query": "mold flux"}

However, AHSS often require the addition of large amounts of alloying elements such as aluminum and this can make it difficult to cast sound slabs without surface defects. When casting high aluminum AHSS, due to the reaction between aluminum in steel and silica in mold flux, the viscosity and crystallization characteristics of the mold slag changes drastically, and deteriorates mold lubrication. Therefore, it is critical to limit the reaction between Al in steel and mold slag and at the same time to provide consistent and adequate mold slag in-use properties. This paper describes the development of non-traditional lime-alumina based mold fluxes which have the potential to reduce slag-steel interaction during casting of high aluminum TRIP steel. Several trial casts of 1.45% Al TRIP steel have been conducted on a pilot caster to examine the performance of mold fluxes developed. When the lime-alumina based mold fluxes were applied successfully, alumina pickup was reduced to less than 5% as compared to 15% alumina pickup for corollary trial casts using conventional lime-silica mold fluxes. The developed lime-alumna mold fluxes showed improved in-mold performance as indicated by enhanced lubrication and stable mold heat transfer, again compared to lime-silica fluxes.

Many researchers have recently studied the mechanism of reducing the heat transfer between the mold and the solidified shell, and some of them have pointed out that the interfacial thermal resistance between the mold and surface of solidified mold flux has caused decreasing heat transfer. In the present study, the surface roughness of solidified mold fluxes used for low carbon and middle carbon steel casting, Na2O-CaO-SiO2 and Li2O-CaO-SiO2 slag systems, was measured by a confocal scanning laser microscope combined with an infrared image furnace. It was found that the surface roughness was in the range of approximately 10-30 μm when the crystalline phase precipitated. Furthermore, the faster the cooling rate, the smoother the surface roughness of the solidified mold flux became. In the contrast, the surface roughness of the slag, of which critical cooling rate is faster, increased. The surface roughness of the mold flux for middle carbon steel casting became rougher than that for low carbon steel casting. As a result, the surface roughness was related to normalized cooling rate, which is the ratio of actual experimental cooling rate to critical cooling rate.

The initial decomposition product was identified as Na2SiO3, irrespective of the mixing ratio of Na2CO3 to SiO2. The governing reaction of the decomposition was concluded to be Na2CO3+SiO2=Na2SiO3(s)+CO2(g). The decomposition rate was independent of the Na2CO3/SiO2 mixing ratio until either one has completely been exhausted and hence was not available any more for the above reaction. If surplus Na2CO3 exists after formation of Na2SiO3 by reacting with all SiO2, the remaining Na2CO3 decomposes partly by reacting with Na2SiO3 to form Na6Si2O7 and partly by thermal self-decomposition.

The crystallization of mold flux promotes mild cooling of the steel shell, but crystallization behavior has been still uncertain. Therefore, this study has been carried out to analyze the crystallization processes of mold flux. Mold flux used in this study has high tendency for crystallization. Quenched specimens were heat-treated in various conditions and characterized. Glassy specimen heat-treated in the electric furnace over 550°C for 180 min crystallized. These crystalline were confirmed to be cuspidine by XRD analysis. The number of grains decreased and the average grain size increased with rise of temperature of heat treatment. The growth velocity also increased with rise of temperature.In-situ observation by the laser microscope revealed that the glassy specimen crystallized in a moment over 600°C and the surface of the specimen turned to be rough. This may lead to mild cooling in the mold.", "source": "https://openalex.org/W2070015879", "pdf_url": "https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/isijinternational/48/3/48_3_277/_pdf", "year": 2008, "country": "IN", "authors": ["Hidenori Mizuno", "Hisao Esaka", "Kei Shinozuka", "Manabu Tamura"], "query": "mold flux"}

Additions of Al2O3 increased the viscosity and higher Al2O3 concentrations modified the dominant silicate network into complex alumino-silicates with the aluminate structure becoming particularly prevalent at an Al2O3 content of 20 mass% and higher. FTIR (Fourier transform infra red) and Raman analysis showed increased amounts of symmetric Al–O0 and Si–O–Al stretching vibrations with higher Al2O3. Compared to the effect of Al2O3, structural changes and the viscosity with higher CaO/(SiO2+Al2O3) were not as significant. However, the symmetric Al–O0 stretching and the Si–O–Al in the [AlO4]5–-tetrahedral units seems to decrease with increased apparent basicity. The apparent activation energy for viscous flow increased with higher Al2O3 due to the increased polymerization of the melt and varied from 129 to 156 kJ/mol.", "source": "https://openalex.org/W372929511", "pdf_url": "https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/isijinternational/53/1/53_170/_pdf", "year": 2013, "country": "AU", "authors": ["Gi-Hyun Kim", "Chang Soo Kim", "Il Sohn"], "query": "mold flux"}

The results showed that Si atoms are replaced by Al atoms as the network formers with the increase in Al 2 O 3 in the mold fluxes. This converts the silicate slags (CaO–SiO 2 mold fluxes) into aluminosilicates slags (CaO–SiO 2 –Al 2 O 3 or CaO–Al 2 O 3 mold fluxes). The F − ions in the mold flux containing Al 2 O 3 are classified into three categories, according to function: Bridging F's, Nonbridging F's, and Free‐F's. The Al 3+ ion holds three distinct coordination environments: IV Al, V Al, and VI Al. The addition of F affects the coordination environment of Al 3+ to form AlO 3 F and AlO 2 F 2 that accommodate the network structure of slags. The network structure in the CaO–SiO 2 mold fluxes is mainly connected through Si–O–Si linkage. However, the network structure of the mold fluxes containing elevated content of Al 2 O 3 is mainly connected through Si–O–Si, Al–O–Al, Al–O–Si, and Al–F–Al linkages. Hence, the structural characteristics of high‐Al steels mold fluxes must be considered during the designing step of the mold fluxes.", "source": "https://openalex.org/W2513903755", "pdf_url": null, "year": 2016, "country": "China", "authors": ["Jinxing Gao", "Guanghua Wen", "Ting Huang", "Binwen Bai", "Ping Tang"], "query": "mold flux"}

It is prevalent view that molten mold flux shows non‐Newtonian behavior, meaning that the viscosity varies with shear rate history. Hence, the present study attempts to evaluate shear thinning, which is one of the characteristic non‐Newtonian behaviors, by measuring its viscosity with a rotating type viscometer at 1623 K. Furthermore, Raman spectroscopy analysis is used to appreciate the structure of molten mold flux and shear thinning. Mold fluxes tested reveal definite shear thinning characteristic of decreasing viscosity with increasing shear rate. The degree of shear thinning has been well quantified by Oswald‐De Waele power law model. Lastly, the degree of polymerization, obtained from Raman spectroscopic data has proportional relationship with degree of shear thinning in the range of 1–5 s −1 shear rate. Also, it has a downward parabolic relationship with degree of shear thinning at entire shear rate ranges up to 100 s −1 .

Therefore, in this paper, the viscosity and crystallization behaviors of conventional F-containing commercial mold flux and newly designed F-free mold fluxes were investigated by using rotating cylinder method and Single/Double Hot Thermocouple Technique (SHTT/DHTT). Results shows that the viscosities of designed F-free mold fluxes are close to the F-containing mold flux; and the crystallization temperatures of F-free mold fluxes increases with the increase of basicity and Na2O/Li2O content; while it decreases with the increase of cooling rate and the addition of B2O3.

Crystallization temperature, CCT curve and crystallization rate were evaluated from the observed images. The evaluated results were compared between two kinds of mold flux, and influence of basicity on crystallization rate was discussed. Crystallization temperature increased with basicity. Crystallization rate also increased with basicity, but its dependency on cooling rate was differed by basicity. The difference could be explained by the viscosity of mold flux at crystallization temperature. Crystallization rate has clear relation to the viscosity at crystallization temperature, and the rate increased with decrease of the viscosity. Two kinds of mold flux were unified in this relationship.
